# Test Coverage State - Week 10 (Post-Entity Migration)

**Snapshot Date:** 2025-10-27
**Migration Context:** After Week 9 entity migrations (ArrowEquipmentSnapshot, EquipmentStatsCache), before Week 10-11 equipment entity and DAO migrations
**Agent:** Agent 3 (AAA - Archery Apprentice Analysis)

---

## Executive Summary

**Overall Coverage:** 82% (2,051+ tests, ~90s execution)
**Health:** ‚úÖ Stable baseline maintained
**Critical Gaps:** Repository layer (74%), Round Scoring UI (70%)

**Key Finding:** Data layer coverage is strong (88-97%), but integration layer (repositories) needs improvement.

## Coverage Breakdown

### Overall Metrics

| Metric | Coverage | Status |
|--------|----------|--------|
| **Instructions** | 82% (55,096 / 66,900) | ‚úÖ Target met |
| **Branches** | 68% (2,718 / 3,956) | ‚ö†Ô∏è Below 75% target |
| **Lines** | 86% (7,889 / 9,178) | ‚úÖ Good |
| **Methods** | 80% (2,148 / 2,685) | ‚úÖ Good |
| **Classes** | 95% (260 / 273) | ‚úÖ Excellent |

**Test Count:** 2,051+ unit tests, 51 instrumented tests

---

## Critical Gaps (<75% Coverage)

### 1. Repository Layer - 74% ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Package:** `com.archeryapprentice.data.repository.impl`
**Impact:** HIGH - Core data access layer
**Files:** 4 repository classes

**Why This Matters:**
- Repositories bridge ViewModels and DAOs
- Critical for offline-first architecture ([[Offline-First Architecture]])
- Integration point for Firebase sync ([[Tournament Sync]])

**Recommendation:** Priority 1 for Week 11-12 improvement
**Estimated Effort:** ~4 hours (repository integration tests)

**Related:** [[HybridTournamentRepository]], [[OfflineTournamentRepository]]

---

### 2. Round Scoring UI - 70% ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Package:** `com.archeryapprentice.ui.roundScoring`
**Impact:** HIGH - Core user-facing feature
**Branch Coverage:** Only 50%! (364 / 732 branches)

**Why This Matters:**
- Primary scoring workflow
- Complex state management (885 cyclomatic complexity)
- Critical user path

**Recommendation:** Priority 2 for Week 13-14 (after repository improvements)
**Estimated Effort:** ~3 hours (UI state tests + branch coverage)

**Related:** [[ActiveScoringScreen]], [[RoundViewModel]]

---

## High Coverage Areas (>90%)

‚úÖ **Authentication** - 98% (robust!)
‚úÖ **Data Services** - 95%
‚úÖ **Equipment Component ViewModels** - 94%
‚úÖ **Equipment Models** - 92%
‚úÖ **Domain Models** - 100% (perfect!)
‚úÖ **Settings UI** - 100% (perfect!)
‚úÖ **Database Migrations** - 92%

**Insight:** Data models and services have excellent coverage. The gap is in integration (repositories) and complex UI (round scoring).

---

## Coverage by Layer

### Data Layer (Strong! 88-97%)

| Component | Coverage | Status |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| **Entities** | 97% | ‚úÖ Excellent |
| **Equipment Models** | 92% | ‚úÖ Good |
| **DAOs** | 88% | ‚úÖ Good |
| **Type Converters** | 88% | ‚úÖ Good |

**Related:** [[Database Migration Plan]], [[Entity Migration]]

---

### Integration Layer (Needs Work - 74%)

| Component | Coverage | Status |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| **Repositories** | 74% | ‚ö†Ô∏è Below target |
| **Services** | 84% | ‚úÖ Good |
| **Authentication** | 98% | ‚úÖ Excellent |

**Gap:** Repository layer needs integration tests (DAO + Repository workflows)

**Related:** [[Repository Pattern]], [[Offline-First Architecture]]

---

### UI Layer (Mixed - 70-94%)

| Component | Coverage | Status |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| **Equipment ViewModels** | 94% | ‚úÖ Excellent |
| **Round Scoring** | 70% | ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs improvement |
| **Tournament UI** | 84% | ‚úÖ Good |
| **Settings UI** | 100% | ‚úÖ Perfect |

**Gap:** Round scoring UI has low branch coverage (50%)

**Related:** [[ActiveScoringScreen]], [[God Classes]]

---

## Flaky Tests

### Known Issues

**Compose UI Tests (Excluded from Release):**
1. `ActiveScoringScreenExtendedTest` - Robolectric incompatibility
2. `ParticipantTabsTest` - Robolectric incompatibility
3. `RoundProgressHeaderTest` - Robolectric incompatibility

**Mitigation:** Excluded from release builds, run only in debug builds
**Long-term Fix:** Migrate to instrumented tests (Espresso + Compose)

**Related:** [[Testing Strategy]], [[Compose UI Testing]]

---

### Scroll Reliability (Philosophy)

**3-Layer Testing Approach:**
- **Layer 1 (80%):** `assertExists()` for data verification (scroll-safe)
- **Layer 2 (5%):** Master scroll tests validate infrastructure
- **Layer 3 (15%):** `assertIsDisplayed()` only for user interactions

**Why:** Android scroll reliability causes `assertIsDisplayed()` failures for off-screen items

**Related:** [[Instrumented Testing]], [[E2E Testing]]

---

## Test Performance

**Baseline:** ~90 seconds for 2,051+ tests ‚úÖ
**Target:** <2 minutes (already meeting!)
**Platform:** Windows PowerShell

**No performance issues detected.** Test execution is efficient.

## Insights & Observations

### 1. Data Layer Strength ‚úÖ

**Observation:** Entities (97%), equipment models (92%), and DAOs (88%) have excellent coverage.

**Why:** Week 3 data layer migration included comprehensive test updates. Entity tests are straightforward (data classes, simple logic).

**Implication:** Solid foundation for Week 10-12 DAO migrations. Low risk of regressions.

**Related:** [[Week 3 Data Layer Migration]]

---

### 2. Repository Integration Gap ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Observation:** Repositories at 74% (below 80% target), despite DAOs at 88%.

**Why:** Repository tests focus on unit-level mocking, not integration with actual DAOs. Integration tests (DAO + Repository) are sparse.

**Implication:** Higher risk of integration issues during DAO migrations (Week 11-12). Repository layer should be priority for improvement.

**Recommendation:** Add repository integration tests BEFORE DAO migrations complete.

**Related:** [[Repository Pattern]], [[HybridTournamentRepository]]

---

### 3. UI Branch Coverage Challenge ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Observation:** Round scoring UI has 70% instruction coverage but only 50% branch coverage.

**Why:** Complex UI state management with many conditional branches. Tests focus on happy paths, not edge cases.

**Implication:** Edge case bugs may exist in production. Error handling, validation, and state transitions under-tested.

**Recommendation:** Add negative tests, edge case tests, and state transition tests for round scoring UI.

**Related:** [[ActiveScoringScreen]], [[State Management]]

---

### 4. God Classes Risk üö®

**Observation:** [[RoundViewModel]] (2,177 lines) and [[LiveScoringViewModel]] (2,015 lines) are god classes with high complexity.

**Coverage Impact:** Large classes with many methods are harder to test comprehensively. Branch coverage suffers.

**Recommendation:** Continue god class extraction efforts ([[God Classes]] refactoring). Smaller classes are easier to test thoroughly.
