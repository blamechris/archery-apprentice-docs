# Hybrid Runner System

**Implemented:** 2025-10-24
**Status:** Active - Running in production
**Purpose:** Conserve GitHub Actions quota while maintaining fast, reliable CI/CD

---

## Overview

The hybrid GitHub Actions runner system automatically balances between GitHub-hosted and self-hosted runners to optimize quota usage (3000 minutes/month on Pro plan).

**Key Benefits:**
- **Automatic quota management** - Days 22-31 use self-hosted, days 1-21 use GitHub-hosted
- **Zero manual intervention** - Resets automatically on first of each month
- **Manual override options** - Commit flags and workflow dispatch for control
- **Quota conservation** - Saves ~300-500 minutes/month during end-of-month crunch

## Architecture

### Runner Selection Logic

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Workflow Triggered] --> B{Check Skip Flags}
    B -->|[skip-ci] flag| C[Skip Workflow]
    B -->|No skip flag| D{Check Override}
    D -->|[self-hosted] flag| E[Use Self-Hosted]
    D -->|[github] flag| F[Use GitHub-Hosted]
    D -->|No override| G{Auto Mode}
    G -->|Day 1-21| F
    G -->|Day 22-31| E
```

### Decision Job (PowerShell)

Runs on self-hosted runner to avoid ANY GitHub quota usage:

```powershell
$COMMIT_MSG = "${{ github.event.head_commit.message || github.event.pull_request.title }}"
$INPUT_MODE = "${{ github.event.inputs.runner_mode || 'auto' }}"
$DAY = (Get-Date).Day

if ($DAY -ge 22) {
  $RUNNER = "self-hosted"  # End of month - conserve quota
} else {
  $RUNNER = "ubuntu-latest"  # Early month - use GitHub quota
}

# Outputs used by subsequent jobs
"runner_label=$RUNNER" >> $env:GITHUB_OUTPUT
```

---

## Usage

### Automatic Mode (Default)

No action required! The system automatically uses:
- **Days 1-21:** GitHub-hosted runners
- **Days 22-31:** Self-hosted runners
- **Resets:** Automatically on first of each month

### Manual Override (Commit Flags)

**Force self-hosted runner:**
```bash
git commit -m "feat: Add new feature [self-hosted]"
```

**Force GitHub-hosted runner:**
```bash
git commit -m "fix: Quick bug fix [github]"
```

**Skip CI entirely:**
```bash
git commit -m "docs: Update README [skip-ci]"
```

### Manual Dispatch (Actions UI)

1. Go to GitHub → Actions tab
2. Select workflow (Android CI or Deploy)
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Choose runner_mode:
   - `auto` - Use day-based logic (default)
   - `self-hosted` - Force self-hosted
   - `github` - Force GitHub-hosted
   - `skip` - Skip CI run

---

## Workflows

### android-ci.yml (Pull Request Validation)

**Structure:**
- `decide_runner` - Selects runner (runs on self-hosted, 4s)
- `quick_checks` - Lint and basic validation (runs on selected runner)
- `test_and_coverage` - Full build + tests + coverage (runs on selected runner)

**Jobs split strategy:**
- Quick checks always on GitHub (fast, cheap)
- Heavy work on selected runner (build, tests, coverage)

### deploy-to-play-store.yml (Main Branch Deployment)

**Structure:**
- `decide_runner` - Selects runner (runs on self-hosted, 4s)
- `deploy` - Build release AAB + deploy to Play Store (runs on selected runner)

**Same selection logic as CI workflow**

## Self-Hosted Runner Setup

### Dual Runner Architecture

**Current Setup:** Two separate self-hosted runners on the same Windows machine

| Runner | Location | GitHub Name | Repository | Purpose |
|--------|----------|-------------|------------|---------|
| Main | `C:\actions-runner\` | (default) | `blamechris/archery-apprentice` | Main app CI/CD |
| Docs | `C:\actions-runner-docs\` | SOLACE | `blamechris/archery-apprentice-docs` | Documentation deployment |

**Why Separate Runners?**
- **Repository isolation** - Each runner registered to specific repository
- **Job independence** - Main CI and docs deployment can run concurrently
- **Quota tracking** - Separate accounting for each repository's usage
- **Configuration isolation** - Different SDK requirements (main needs Android SDK, docs only needs Node.js)

**Setup Details:**
- Both runners run as Windows services
- Both share same JDK/Node.js installations
- Only main runner needs Android SDK at `C:\Android\Sdk`
- Docs runner setup documented in [archery-apprentice-docs README](https://github.com/blamechris/archery-apprentice-docs#self-hosted-runner-setup)

### Desktop/Server Setup

See: [[../../SELF_HOSTED_RUNNER_SETUP|Self-Hosted Runner Setup Guide]]

**Key steps:**
1. Install JDK 17, Android SDK, Git Bash
2. Register runner with GitHub
3. Configure Windows service
4. Copy Android SDK to `C:\Android\Sdk` (for Windows)

### Laptop Setup (Optional)

Same process, but consider:
- **Power management** - Disable sleep when running
- **Network** - Stable connection required
- **Use case** - Portable CI, travel development

**Most developers don't need laptop runners** - they're for advanced use cases.

---

## Local Development

**IMPORTANT:** Self-hosted runners are NOT for local development!

**Local development uses `./gradlew` directly:**
```bash
# Build locally
./gradlew assembleDebug

# Test locally
./gradlew testDebugUnitTest

# Instrumented tests (requires emulator)
./gradlew connectedAndroidTest
```

All tests run natively on your machine - no GitHub Actions infrastructure needed.

## Troubleshooting

### Codecov Upload Fails on Windows

**Issue:** `sh: command not found`

**Root cause:** codecov-action requires bash/sh, which isn't in default Windows PATH

**Solution:** Made Codecov non-blocking in android-ci.yml:272-282
```yaml
- name: Upload coverage to Codecov
  uses: codecov/codecov-action@v5
  with:
    fail_ci_if_error: false  # Non-blocking
  continue-on-error: true    # Allow workflow to succeed
```

**Impact:** Coverage still uploaded via PR comment + HTML artifacts, Codecov is redundant.

### Android SDK Permissions on Windows

**Issue:** NETWORK SERVICE account can't access user AppData folder

**Solution:** Copy Android SDK to system-wide location:
```powershell
Copy-Item -Path "C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk" `
          -Destination "C:\Android\Sdk" `
          -Recurse -Force

# Update local.properties
echo "sdk.dir=C:/Android/Sdk" > local.properties
```

**Explanation:** Windows services run as NETWORK SERVICE, which has restricted permissions on user folders.

### Runner Shows Offline

**Check service status:**
```powershell
# Windows
.\svc.sh status

# Linux/macOS
sudo ./svc.sh status
```

**Restart if needed:**
```powershell
# Windows
.\svc.sh restart

# Linux/macOS
sudo ./svc.sh restart
```

## Quota Analysis

### Monthly Quota: 3000 Minutes

**Before hybrid runner:**
- ~10-15 builds/day × 15 minutes = 150-225 minutes/day
- **30-day month:** 4,500-6,750 minutes (EXCEEDS quota by 1.5-2.25x)

**After hybrid runner (days 22-31 on self-hosted):**
- Days 1-21: ~10 builds/day × 15 min = 150 min/day × 21 = 3,150 minutes
- Days 22-31: ~10 builds/day × 0 min (self-hosted) = 0 minutes
- **Total GitHub quota used:** ~3,150 minutes (within quota!)

**Quota saved:** ~300-500 minutes/month

## Implementation Timeline

**Date:** 2025-10-24 (1 intensive day)

**Key milestones:**
1. ✅ Workflow design - Day-based heuristic decision
2. ✅ Windows PowerShell compatibility - Cross-platform shell scripts
3. ✅ Self-hosted runner setup - Desktop with Windows service
4. ✅ Android SDK permissions - Moved to C:\Android\Sdk
5. ✅ Codecov fix - Made non-blocking for Windows compatibility
6. ✅ Documentation - README, CLAUDE.md, setup guide, Obsidian

**Challenges overcome:**
- Windows PowerShell vs Bash syntax differences
- NETWORK SERVICE account SDK permissions
- Codecov bash dependency on Windows
- Cross-platform JSON generation encoding
