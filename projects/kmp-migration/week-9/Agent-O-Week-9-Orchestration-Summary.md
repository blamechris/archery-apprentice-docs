## Emergency Incident Response

**Date:** 2025-10-26
**Issue:** Self-hosted Windows runner file lock
**Duration:** ~2 hours (detection to resolution)

### Timeline

1. **Detection (2025-10-26 afternoon):** PR #160 CI failures with `AccessDeniedException` on Android SDK jar
2. **Initial Response:** Multiple cleanup attempts (Gradle daemons, Java processes, file ownership)
3. **Escalation:** Discovered conflicting runner configurations, removed problematic runner
4. **Pause:** All 3 agents notified with clear pause messages
5. **Emergency Agent Deployed:** Comprehensive mission document created
6. **Root Cause Identified:** local.properties with hardcoded SDK path + orphaned Java processes
7. **Resolution:** Agent 1 removed local.properties, emergency agent created fresh isolated runners
8. **Verification:** PR #160 merged successfully after fix

### Root Cause

**Primary Issues:**
1. `local.properties` committed to git with hardcoded SDK path (`C:\Users\chris_3zal3ta\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk`)
2. Orphaned Java/Gradle processes holding file locks on `core-lambda-stubs.jar`
3. Misconfigured runner names ("SOLACE" instead of proper naming)
4. No workspace isolation between runner jobs

**Contributing Factors:**
- Windows file locks persisting across process terminations
- Self-hosted runner reusing same SDK directories
- No monitoring for orphaned processes

### Resolution

**Phase 1: Clear File Locks**
- Killed all orphaned Java/Gradle processes
- Restarted runner services

**Phase 2: Remove Misconfigured Runners**
- Removed old runners (IDs 21, 22) from GitHub
- Cleared runner directories

**Phase 3: Create Fresh Isolated Runners**
- Used `setup-self-hosted-runners.ps1` script
- Created 3 isolated runners (2 for main repo, 1 for docs repo)
- Separate `_work` directories per runner
- Unique Gradle caches per runner

**Phase 4: Install as Services**
- Windows services for auto-start
- Proper naming convention (win-runner-01, win-runner-02, docs-runner-01)

**Phase 5: Documentation**
- Incident report: `docs/SELF_HOSTED_RUNNER_INCIDENT_2025-10-26.md`
- Setup guide: `docs/SELF_HOSTED_RUNNER_SETUP.md`
- Emergency protocol: `docs/AGENT_MESSAGES/WEEK_9/EMERGENCY_RUNNER_FIX.md`
- Updated CLAUDE.md with troubleshooting section

### Prevention Measures

1. **Added to .gitignore:** local.properties (prevent future commits)
2. **Runner Setup Script:** Automated provisioning with isolation
3. **Monitoring:** Documented cleanup procedures for orphaned processes
4. **Documentation:** Comprehensive incident report for future reference

## Process Improvements

### 1. PR Title Convention

**Format:** `[AGENT-ID] Descriptive Title`
- [AAP] = Agent 1 (Platform)
- [AAM] = Agent 2 (Modules)
- [AAA] = Agent 3 (Analysis)
- [Agent-O] = Orchestrator

**Benefits:**
- Quick identification of agent ownership
- Easy PR filtering in GitHub (`is:pr [AAM]`)
- Clear review assignment
- Better retrospectives

**Implementation:** PR #161 (merged 2025-10-26T23:41:22Z)

### 2. Multi-Agent Communication Protocol

**Hybrid System:**
- **File-based messages** (>30 lines): Stored in `docs/AGENT_MESSAGES/WEEK_N/agent-X/`
- **Inline delimiters** (<30 lines): Direct prompts with `----StartPrompt(AGENT)----` markers
- **Status tracking:** In file headers (READY, SENT, CANCELLED, COMPLETED)
- **Lifecycle management:** Update message status after execution

**Benefits:**
- Better organization and searchability
- Clear message ownership and timeline
- Easier context resumption
- Version control for agent communications

**Implementation:** PR #163 (merged 2025-10-27T01:54:30Z)

### 3. End-of-Day Documentation Protocol

**New Workflow:**
- Each agent updates their context document at end of day
- Creates Obsidian vault entry summarizing work
- Updates message file with execution summary for Agent O
- Creates 2 PRs (context update + vault entry)

**Benefits:**
- Clear session boundaries
- Better handoff between sessions
- Preserved context for resumption
- Automatic vault documentation

**Agent O reads summaries at start:** Added to `AGENT_O_ORCHESTRATOR.md` session resume protocol

### 4. Obsidian Vault Workflow Clarified

**Correct Process:**
1. Create PR in archery-apprentice-docs repo
2. User reviews and merges
3. GitHub Actions auto-deploys to vault
4. **Never run deploy.ps1 manually**

**Benefits:**
- PR review before deployment
- Automatic deployment (no manual steps)
- Clear workflow documented

   - Need monitoring for orphaned Java processes
   - Consider periodic runner health checks
   - Automate cleanup procedures
   - Better error detection (catch issues faster)

2. **local.properties:**
   - Should have been in .gitignore from start
   - Add to agent onboarding checklist
   - Prevent accidental commits of machine-specific config

3. **Emergency Detection:**
   - Could detect CI failures faster (alert after 2-3 failures)
   - Consider automated notifications
   - Better visibility into runner health

4. **Agent Communication:**
   - Agent 3 initially misunderstood end-of-day cleanup task
   - Could make instructions even clearer
   - Consider templates for common responses

2. **Infrastructure Matters:**
   - Self-hosted runners need isolated workspaces
   - Windows file locks can persist across processes
   - Fresh runner creation often faster than debugging
   - **Lesson:** Don't hesitate to rebuild infrastructure when troubleshooting stalls

3. **Documentation Pays Off:**
   - Obsidian vault workflow now clear (no more confusion)
   - Context documents critical for session resumption
   - Incident reports prevent repeating mistakes
   - End-of-day summaries improve handoff
   - **Lesson:** Invest in documentation during incidents, not just after

4. **Clear Ownership Works:**
   - PR title convention ([AGENT-ID]) improved visibility
   - Easy to see who owns what
   - Faster coordination decisions
   - **Lesson:** Simple conventions have outsized impact

5. **Emergency Protocols:**
   - Pause notifications preserved agent context
