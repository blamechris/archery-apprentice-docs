#### ⏸️ Week 2: Repository Migration (IN PROGRESS)

**Status:** Phase 1 - Preparation Complete, Waiting for Dependencies
**Current Date:** 2025-10-21
**Estimated Completion:** ~5-7 days after dependencies resolve

**Agent Assignments:**
- **Agent 1 (AAP):** Domain model migration (BLOCKING Agent 2)
- **Agent 2 (AAM):** Repository migration (BLOCKED - waiting for Agent 1 & Agent 3)
- **Agent 3 (AAA):** HybridTournamentRepository split (BLOCKING Agent 2)

**Agent 2 Progress (Preparation Phase):**
- ✅ Created Week 2 Migration Plan (17 pages, 727 lines)
- ✅ Created Room KMP Migration Guide (43 pages, 1,229 lines)
- ✅ Created 4 Obsidian vault conceptual docs (2,000+ lines)
- ⏸️ Waiting for Agent 1 (domain models) and Agent 3 (repo split) to merge
- ⏸️ Ready to begin Phase 2 (repository interface migration) when dependencies resolve

**Blocking Dependencies:**
1. **Agent 1 (Domain Models):**
   - Status: In progress (~50% done)
   - Blocking: Repository interfaces reference domain models
   - Estimated: 2-3 days to completion

2. **Agent 3 (Repository Split):**
   - Status: In progress (ahead of schedule)
   - Blocking: HybridTournamentRepository being split into 4 repos
   - Estimated: 2-3 days to completion

**Repositories to Migrate (14 total):**
- [ ] TournamentRepository (4 interfaces from Agent 3's split)
- [ ] RoundRepository (needs interface extraction)
- [ ] Equipment Repositories (11 classes, need interface extraction)

**Planned Deliverables:**
- Repository interfaces in `shared/domain` (~1,000 lines)
- Repository implementations in `shared/data` (~2,200 lines)
- Room database configuration in `shared/database`
- SharedModuleFactory DI setup in `shared/di`

**Estimated Timeline:**
- Preparation: ✅ Complete (2-3 days)
- Waiting for dependencies: ⏸️ In progress (3-5 days)
- Phase 2 (Interfaces): 2-3 days
- Phase 3 (Implementations): 2-3 days
- Phase 4 (Database): 3-4 days
- Phase 5 (DI): 1-2 days
- Phase 6 (Testing): 2-3 days
- **Total:** 15-20 days

---

## Dependencies & Coordination

### Critical Path

```
Week 2:
  Agent 1 (Domain Models)
    ↓
  Agent 3 (Repository Split)
    ↓
  Agent 2 (Repository Migration)
```

**Why This Order:**
1. **Agent 1 first:** Domain models must be in `shared/domain` before repository interfaces can reference them
2. **Agent 3 second:** Repository split creates clean architecture for Agent 2 to migrate
3. **Agent 2 third:** Migrates clean, split repositories (avoids merge conflicts)

### Strategic Waiting (Agent 2)

**Productive Waiting Strategy:**
- ✅ Created comprehensive technical documentation (2 docs, 60 pages)
- ✅ Created comprehensive conceptual documentation (4 docs, 60+ pages)
- ✅ Analyzed current database (23 entities, 14 DAOs, 19 migrations)
- ✅ Documented migration patterns and strategies
- ⏸️ Standing by for Phase 2 execution

**Time Saved by Waiting:**
- Avoided: 2-3 days merge conflict resolution
- Avoided: 1-2 days re-migration work
- Gained: 5-7 hours faster Phase 4 execution (Room guide)
- **Net Benefit:** 3-5 days saved

---

## Key Architectural Decisions

### 1. Manual DI (No Hilt/Koin)

**Decision:** Continue manual DI with SharedModuleFactory pattern

**Rationale:**
- Matches existing app architecture (RepositoryFactory)
- Simple, explicit, debuggable
- No third-party framework learning curve
- Can add Koin later if needed

**Status:** ✅ Established in Week 1

---

### 2. Room KMP 2.8.1 for Database

**Decision:** Use Room KMP (not SQLDelight)

**Rationale:**
- Keep existing Room code (zero migration effort)
- Team expertise with Room API
- Official Google/JetBrains support
- Maturing rapidly (Alpha → Beta expected)

**Status:** ✅ Configured in Week 1

---

### 3. Offline-First Architecture

**Decision:** Local Room database as source of truth, Firebase syncs in background

**Rationale:**
- Users score rounds offline (field, competition venues with poor connectivity)
- Instant user experience (no loading states)
- Proven pattern (existing app uses this)

**Status:** ✅ Maintained in migration

---

### 4. Hybrid Repository Pattern

**Decision:** Combine local + remote data sources in single repository

**Rationale:**
- Simplifies ViewModels/Presenters
- Encapsulates sync complexity
- Proven pattern (existing HybridTournamentRepository)

**Status:** ⏸️ Being refined by Agent 3 (split into specialized repos)

---

### 5. Incremental Migration (Not Big Bang)

**Decision:** Migrate one layer at a time, keep app working

**Rationale:**
- Lower risk (app continues to work)
- Easier to test (smaller changes)
- Continuous delivery (merge weekly)

**Status:** ✅ Active (Week 2 in progress)

---

## Next Steps (Immediate)

### For Agent 1 (Domain Models)
1. ⏸️ Continue migrating domain models to `shared/domain`
2. ⏸️ Remove Android-specific code (java.util.Date, System.currentTimeMillis)
3. ⏸️ Ensure Room annotations preserved
4. ⏸️ Test all models compile in shared/domain
5. ⏸️ Merge PR to main

**Estimated Completion:** 2-3 days

---

### For Agent 3 (Repository Split)
1. ⏸️ Complete HybridTournamentRepository split (4 specialized repos)
2. ⏸️ Test all tournament flows (create, join, score, sync)
3. ⏸️ Update call sites to use split repos
4. ⏸️ Merge PR to main

**Estimated Completion:** 2-3 days

---

### For Agent 2 (Repository Migration)
1. ⏸️ Wait for Agent 1 & Agent 3 PRs to merge
2. ⏸️ Pull latest main (get domain models + split repos)
3. ⏸️ Begin Phase 2: Repository interface migration
4. ⏸️ Use Room KMP Migration Guide for Phase 4

**Estimated Start:** 2-3 days (when dependencies merge)
**Estimated Duration:** 12-17 days active work

---

## Weekly Retrospectives

### Week 1 Retrospective

**✅ What Went Well:**
- Git worktrees enabled true parallel development
- Strategic merge order minimized conflicts
- Agent context handoff protocol worked well
- Coverage enforcement established (hybrid approach)

**⚠️ What Was Harder Than Expected:**
- Coverage work is discovery-heavy (not just writing tests)
- Tooling claims needed verification (coverage, detekt not configured)
- Platform abstractions required comprehensive test mocking
- Time estimates were overly optimistic (7x → 2-3x speedup)

**📋 Lessons Learned:**
- Factor coverage work into estimates upfront
- Verify all tooling claims before starting
- Plan test infrastructure changes when adding abstractions
- Use conservative multipliers for parallel work (2-3x, not 5-7x)

**📈 Process Improvements:**
- Verify tooling claims upfront (before starting work)
- Factor coverage work into estimates
- Plan test infrastructure changes proactively
- Use conservative time estimates (2-3x multiplier)

**Status:** Retrospective complete, documented in `docs/retrospectives-kmp-migration/week-1-retrospective.md`

---

### Week 2 Retrospective (Pending)

**Status:** Week 2 in progress
**Retrospective Date:** After Week 2 completion (~5-7 days)
