# KMP Migration Project - Archery Apprentice

**Status:** Week 1 in progress  
**Started:** 2025-10-18  
**Goal:** Migrate Android app to Kotlin Multiplatform to enable iOS development  
**Tags:** #kmp #kotlin-multiplatform #ios #migration #architecture

---

## Project Overview

### Mission
Migrate the Archery Apprentice Android app to Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) to enable code sharing between Android and iOS platforms. This is a strategic architectural transformation to expand the app from Android-only to cross-platform.

### Key Objectives
- [ ] Extract platform-agnostic business logic into shared modules
- [ ] Create platform abstractions for Android-specific dependencies
- [ ] Refactor god classes to enable better code organization
- [ ] Maintain 80% test coverage throughout migration
- [ ] Enable iOS development with shared codebase

---

## Strategic Approach: Parallel Agent Migration

### Why Parallel Agents?
Traditional sequential migration would take weeks of blocking work. By using 3 parallel agents working in Git worktrees, we can:
- Complete Week 1 in ~3 days instead of 3+ weeks
- Maintain app stability (agents work on branches, not main)
- Minimize merge conflicts through strategic merge ordering
- Enable experimentation without risk to production code

### Three-Agent Strategy

**Agent 1 (AAP) - Platform Abstractions**
- **Branch:** `kmp-migration/platform-abstractions`
- **Mission:** Remove Android `Context` dependencies from domain layer
- **Deliverables:**
  - Platform abstraction interfaces (PreferenceStorage, NetworkMonitor, TournamentModeProvider)
  - Android implementations in app module
  - Clean domain layer (no Android SDK dependencies)
  - Updated test mocks for platform abstractions

**Agent 2 (AAM) - Module Setup**
- **Branch:** `kmp-migration/module-setup` (MERGED)
- **Mission:** Create KMP shared modules structure
- **Deliverables:**
  - 6 shared modules (common, domain, data, database, presentation, di)
  - Room KMP 2.8.1 configuration
  - Gradle build scripts for multiplatform
  - MODULE_ARCHITECTURE.md and DI_STRATEGY.md documentation

**Agent 3 (AAA) - Code Analysis**
- **Branch:** `kmp-migration/code-analysis` (MERGED)
- **Mission:** Analyze god classes and create extraction plans
- **Deliverables:**
  - GOD_CLASS_EXTRACTION_PLANS.md (3 god classes analyzed)
  - VIEWMODEL_INVENTORY.md (25 ViewModels catalogued)
  - WEEK_5_8_PLAN.md (service extraction roadmap)
  - Refactoring priority recommendations

---

## Week 1 Progress

### ‚úÖ Completed
1. **Agent 3 (AAA)** - Code analysis complete, PR merged
   - Identified 3 god classes (LiveScoringViewModel: 2,015 lines, HybridTournamentRepository: 1,808 lines, RoundViewModel: 2,177 lines)
   - Created extraction roadmaps for Weeks 5-8
   - Catalogued all 25 ViewModels in the app

2. **Agent 2 (AAM)** - Module setup complete, PR merged
   - Created shared KMP module structure
   - Configured Room KMP 2.8.1 with KSP
   - Documented DI strategy (manual DI via SharedModuleFactory)
   - Integrated with existing Android app gradle structure

### ‚è≥ In Progress
3. **Agent 1 (AAP)** - Platform abstractions (raising code coverage)
   - Created 3 platform abstractions
   - Removed Context from 6 domain layer files
   - Fixed 96 test occurrences across 15 files
   - Currently raising test coverage to meet 80% threshold

## Critical Technical Decisions

### 1. Git Worktrees Over Docker
**Decision:** Use Git worktrees for parallel agent work  
**Rationale:**
- Setup time: 30 seconds vs 2 hours for Docker
- No learning curve vs 3-4 hours for Docker
- Native performance (no overhead)
- Perfect for our use case (same machine, different branches)

**Impact:** All 3 agents working efficiently in parallel without conflicts

### 2. Manual DI Over Hilt/Koin
**Decision:** Extend existing RepositoryFactory pattern to SharedModuleFactory  
**Rationale:**
- Project already uses manual DI successfully
- No learning curve for existing patterns
- Easier incremental migration
- KMP DI libraries less mature than Android equivalents

**Impact:** Consistent DI approach across Android and shared code

### 3. Merge Order: Agent 3 ‚Üí Agent 2 ‚Üí Agent 1
**Decision:** Strategic merge ordering based on risk  
**Rationale:**
1. Agent 3: Documentation only (safest, no code conflicts)
2. Agent 2: New modules (additive, no existing code changes)
3. Agent 1: Modifies existing code (needs clean base from Agent 2's modules)

**Impact:** Minimized merge conflicts, enabled continuous parallel work

## Technical Challenges Resolved

### Challenge 1: Kotlin Version Conflict
**Problem:** Room KMP 2.8.1 pulled Kotlin 2.1.20-dev, project uses 2.0.21  
**Error:** `Incompatible ABI version. Current: '1.8.0', found: '1.201.0'`  
**Solution:** Force resolution in shared/di/build.gradle.kts
```kotlin
configurations.all {
    resolutionStrategy {
        force("org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-stdlib:2.0.21")
        force("org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-stdlib-common:2.0.21")
    }
}
```

### Challenge 2: Test Failures from Platform Abstractions
**Problem:** 21+ test failures after removing Context parameters  
**Root Cause:** `RepositoryFactory.createTournamentRepository()` checks `PlatformProvider.isInitialized()`, falls back to `OfflineTournamentRepository` when false  
**Solution:** Created MockPlatformProviders.kt, mocked PlatformProvider in all affected tests  
**Smart Fix:** Fixed `RoundViewModelTestBase.kt` which cascaded to 19 child test files

### Challenge 3: Worktree Isolation
**Problem:** Agents can't see each other's files (expected worktree behavior)  
**Solution:** Strategic merge order - Agent 3 merges first, others pull main to get docs  
**Lesson:** Coordination requires explicit merge strategy

## Architecture Foundation

### Current Android App
- **Type:** Single-module Android app
- **Build System:** Gradle with version catalog (libs.versions.toml)
- **DI:** Manual (RepositoryFactory pattern)
- **Database:** Room (migrating to Room KMP)
- **UI:** Jetpack Compose
- **Target SDK:** compileSdk=36, minSdk=31
- **JVM:** Java 11
- **Kotlin:** 2.0.21

### Target KMP Architecture
```
shared/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ common/          # Common utilities, expect/actual
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ domain/          # Business logic (platform-agnostic)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data/            # Repository implementations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ database/        # Room KMP database
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ presentation/    # ViewModels, UI state
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ di/              # Dependency injection
```

### Platform Abstractions Created
1. **PreferenceStorage** - SharedPreferences wrapper (was using Context.getSharedPreferences)
2. **NetworkMonitor** - ConnectivityManager wrapper (was using Context.getSystemService)
3. **TournamentModeProvider** - Build config access (was using Context for debug/release detection)

---

## Test Coverage Strategy

### Coverage Requirements
- **Threshold:** 80% (enforced in CI/CD)
- **Current Tests:** 238 unit tests + 51 instrumented tests
- **Strategy:** Maintain coverage throughout migration

### Testing Approach for Migration
- Each agent must maintain/raise test coverage
- Platform abstractions require comprehensive test mocking
- Shared module tests must be platform-agnostic
- Use MockPlatformProviders.kt for platform dependency mocking

---
