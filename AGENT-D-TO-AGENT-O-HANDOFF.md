## Lessons Learned

### Critical Policy Violation

**Root Cause:** Following commit templates without checking CLAUDE.md policy

**Resolution:**
- Rewrote git history to remove all attribution
- Created clean commits/PRs
- Documented policy understanding

**Going Forward:** NEVER add attribution to:
- ‚ùå Commits (no "Co-Authored-By", no "Generated with")
- ‚ùå PRs (no attribution in descriptions)
- ‚ùå ANY git operations on ANY repo

**User is SOLE AUTHOR - always.**
