# V2.0 Release Completion - October 18, 2025

## Session Overview

**Date:** 2025-10-18
**Branch:** `migration-test-cleanup`  
**Commit:** `2c50a02`
**Status:** ✅ V2.0 RELEASED (86% completion)

## Major Accomplishments

### Feature #6: Tournament Bow Setup Tracking ✅

**Implemented in ~4 hours** (original estimate: 4-6 weeks)

#### Key Discovery
Data models already existed in codebase:
- `TournamentParticipant.bowSetupId` (line 45)
- `TournamentParticipantEntity.bowSetupId` (line 54)

This pattern repeated from Features #1, #3, #5: **Backend exists before UI**

#### Implementation

**1. TournamentDetailsUiState** (3 new fields)
```kotlin
val availableBowSetups: List<BowSetup> = emptyList()
val selectedBowSetupId: Long? = null
val showBowSetupSelector: Boolean = false
```

**2. TournamentDetailsViewModel** (4 new methods)
- `loadAvailableBowSetups()` - Auto-selects default setup
- `showBowSetupSelector()` - Opens dialog
- `hideBowSetupSelector()` - Closes dialog
- `selectBowSetup(Long?)` - Saves selection
- Updated `joinTournament()` to include `bowSetupId`

**3. BowSetupSelectorDialog.kt** (NEW - 170 lines)
- Material 3 AlertDialog
- Lists all user bow setups
- "No Equipment Tracking" option
- Selection highlighting
- Professional UX

**4. TournamentDetailsScreen.kt**
- Equipment selector card before "Join Tournament" button
- Shows selected setup or "No equipment tracking"
- [Change] button opens dialog

#### Build Verification
```bash
CI=true ./gradlew assembleDebug --no-daemon
# Result: BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 23s
```

**Technical Highlights:**
- ✅ No database migration required
- ✅ Backward compatible (bowSetupId = null allowed)
- ✅ Smart defaults (auto-selects default setup)
- ✅ Build successful on first attempt

### V2.0 Ship Decision ✅

**Decision:** Ship V2.0 at 86% completion (6/7 features)

#### Rationale
1. All HIGH and CRITICAL priority features complete
2. Feature #4 requires 3-4 weeks of UX research (cannot code without user validation)
3. User goal: "wrap up V2.0 to begin DB migration work"
4. Shipping at 86% unblocks critical infrastructure work
5. Deferred feature properly documented in V2.1_BACKLOG.md

#### Features Shipped
1. ✅ Multiple Guests in Offline Rounds
2. ✅ Version Number in Settings
3. ✅ Scoring System Defaults
4. ⏭️ Visual Scoring UX → V2.1 (requires UX research)
5. ✅ Tournament Guest Management
6. ✅ Tournament Bow Setup Tracking
7. ✅ E2E Testing Infrastructure Phase 1

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Data Models Often Precede UI
**Discovery:** 3 features (#1, #3, #6) had backend ready but no UI

**Implication:** Always check data models before estimating UI work

**Time Savings:** Feature #6 took 4 hours vs 4-6 week estimate (97% reduction)

### 2. Shipping at 86% is Pragmatic
**Context:** All critical features done, remaining feature needs research

**Decision:** Ship now to unblock DB migration work

**Outcome:** Substantial value delivered, nothing lost (V2.1 backlog created)

### 3. User Research Cannot Be Rushed
**Feature #4:** Requires UX testing to validate solutions

**Wrong Approach:** Guess at UX pattern and implement

**Right Approach:** Document in backlog, conduct research, then implement

### 4. Documentation as Deliverable
**Problem:** Deferred features can be forgotten

**Solution:** V2.1_BACKLOG.md ensures Feature #4 context preserved

**Includes:** Problem statement, proposed solutions, open questions, research plan

### 5. Pattern Recognition
**Observation:** Similar discoveries in Features #1, #5 (both undocumented)

**Hypothesis:** More undocumented features may exist in codebase

**Action:** Investigate before assuming work is needed
