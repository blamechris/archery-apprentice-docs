## Reviewing Previous Ends

During a round, you can review ends you've already scored.

### Why Review Previous Ends?

- Verify score entry accuracy
- Check for patterns (fatigue, consistency)
- Compare current end to previous performance
- Mental preparation for next end

### How to Review

**Steps:**
1. While scoring a round (IN_PROGRESS)
2. Tap **Review Ends** or **End History**
3. See list of completed ends with:
   - End number
   - Arrow scores
   - End total
   - Running total after that end
4. Tap on an end to see details
5. Tap **Back** to return to current scoring

**What You See:**
- All arrow scores for that end
- X-ring marks (if applicable)
- End total and average
- Running total at that point
- Which participant (multi-participant rounds)

### Editing Previous Ends

**Important:** You generally **cannot** edit previous ends once submitted to preserve data integrity.

**Exception:** If you notice a mistake immediately, some implementations allow editing the most recent end.

For older ends, see [Correcting Scoring Mistakes](#correcting-scoring-mistakes).

## Correcting Scoring Mistakes

Everyone makes mistakes - here's how to fix them.

### During the Same End (Before "Next End")

**Easy fix:**
1. Notice the mistake before moving to next end
2. Tap the arrow score to edit
3. Change the value
4. End total recalculates automatically
5. Tap **Next End** when satisfied

### After Moving to Next End

**More involved:**

**Option 1: Review and Edit (if supported)**
1. Tap **Review Ends**
2. Find the end with the mistake
3. If edit is enabled for recent ends, tap **Edit**
4. Correct the scores
5. Save changes

**Option 2: Note for Later**
- Continue the round as-is
- Note the mistake in round description or notes
- Understand the statistics will reflect the error

**Option 3: Cancel and Restart**
- If the mistake is severe and early in the round
- Cancel the current round
- Start a new round with correct data

### Best Practices to Avoid Mistakes

**Before Entering Scores:**
- Count arrows shot (should match arrows per end)
- Verify scores with shooting partner if available
- Double-check X-ring marks

**When Entering:**
- Enter scores slowly and deliberately
- Verify end total before moving to next end
- Use consistent method (highest to lowest, left to right, etc.)

**After the Round:**
- Review final statistics for anomalies
- Check for impossible scores (e.g., 7 tens in a 6-arrow end)

## Different Scoring Systems

Archery Apprentice supports multiple scoring systems for different disciplines.

### 10-Ring System (Standard Outdoor)

**How it works:**
- 10 rings: 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
- Inner 10 is X-ring (for tie-breaking)
- Miss = 0 points

**Common uses:**
- Olympic recurve (outdoor)
- Target archery competitions
- Most standard practice rounds

**Scoring tips:**
- Always mark X-ring hits
- X-count matters for rankings
- Used with 122cm or 80cm targets

### 6-Ring System (NFAA)

**How it works:**
- 6 rings only: 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
- Simplified from 10-ring
- Used in field archery

**Common uses:**
- NFAA field rounds
- Casual practice
- Beginners

**Scoring tips:**
- Easier for beginners to score
- Fewer judgment calls on line breaks
- Different target face (6-ring target)

### 5-Zone System (Simplified)

**How it works:**
- 5 zones: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
- Very simple, great for practice
- Quick to score

**Common uses:**
- Practice rounds
- Training new archers
- Focus on form over score

### X-Ring Compound Scoring

**How it works:**
- Same as 10-ring, but X-ring is smaller
- X-ring = 10 points (but marked differently)
- Used in compound archery

**Common uses:**
- Compound bow competitions
- Precision shooting disciplines

**Scoring tips:**
- X-ring is much smaller than recurve X-ring
- Every arrow touching inner 10 counts as X
- Critical for compound rankings

### Selecting Scoring System

**When creating a round:**
1. On round creation screen
2. Select **Scoring System** dropdown
3. Choose:
   - 10-ring
   - 6-ring
   - 5-zone
   - X-ring (compound)
   - Others as available
4. App validates scores based on system chosen

**Changing Scoring System:**
- **Cannot** change scoring system mid-round
- Must complete or cancel round first
- Create new round with correct system
