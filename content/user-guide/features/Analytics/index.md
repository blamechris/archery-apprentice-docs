# Analytics Features

Archery Apprentice provides comprehensive analytics to help you understand your performance, identify trends, and optimize your equipment choices. The analytics system tracks everything from basic scoring statistics to advanced shot grouping analysis.

## Overview

Analytics features are organized into several categories:
- **Round Statistics** - Immediate feedback after each round
- **Equipment Performance** - Track how each bow setup performs
- **Shot Grouping Analysis** - Understand arrow placement consistency (when using target face scoring)
- **Fatigue Analysis** - Identify performance drops during longer sessions
- **Consistency Metrics** - Measure end-to-end score variation
- **Equipment Comparison** - Compare statistics across different setups

---

## Round Statistics

After completing any round, you get instant statistics:

### Basic Metrics

**Aggregate Statistics**
- **Total Score** - Sum of all arrow scores
- **Average per Arrow** - Total score divided by number of arrows
- **Average per End** - Total score divided by number of ends
- **Accuracy Percentage** - Your score as a percentage of the maximum possible

**Ring Distribution**
- **X-ring Count** - Inner 10 hits (critical for tie-breaking)
- **10-ring Count** - All 10s (including X-ring)
- **9-ring Count** - Number of 9s shot
- **8-ring and below** - Distribution across remaining rings

> **Tie-Breaking Note:** In competitive archery, ties are broken by X-ring count, then 10-ring count. The app tracks these automatically.

### End-by-End Breakdown

View detailed statistics for each end:
- **End Number** and **Score**
- **Running Total** after that end
- **Average for that end**
- **Best and worst ends** highlighted

This helps you identify:
- **Fatigue patterns** - Are your later ends consistently lower?
- **Warm-up effects** - Do you shoot better after the first end?
- **Consistency issues** - Large score swings between ends

## Equipment Performance Analytics

Access comprehensive equipment statistics through the **Equipment Analytics Hub** on the Equipment Page.

### Performance by Bow Setup

For each bow setup, view:
- **Total Rounds Scored** with this setup
- **Average Score** across all rounds
- **Best Round** score
- **Accuracy Percentage** average
- **Ring Distribution** (X-count, 10-count, etc.)

### Performance by Distance

See how each setup performs at different ranges:
- **50 meters** - Indoor/outdoor mid-range
- **70 meters** - Olympic outdoor distance
- **18 meters** - Indoor standard
- **Custom distances** - Any distance you've shot

**Example Use Case:**
Compare your "Indoor Setup" at 18m vs your "Outdoor Setup" at 18m to understand which configuration works better indoors.

### Equipment Comparison Screen

## Advanced Shot Grouping Analysis

When you use **Target Face Scoring** (tapping on the target to mark arrow positions), the app captures arrow coordinates and calculates sophisticated grouping metrics.

### Shot Grouping Metrics

**Eccentricity**
- Measures how "stretched" your shot group is
- Value between 0 (perfectly circular) and 1 (highly elliptical)
- Lower is better - indicates consistent, circular grouping
- **Example:** 0.2 = nice circular group, 0.8 = arrows spread in a line

**Radial Standard Deviation**
- Measures spread of arrows from the center of your group
- Expressed in target units (e.g., millimeters or inches)
- Lower is better - tighter grouping
- **Example:** 15mm radial SD = arrows typically land within 15mm of group center

**Bias Direction**
- Shows if your group has a directional tendency
- Expressed as compass direction (e.g., "2 o'clock", "10 o'clock")
- Helps identify aiming or form issues
- **Example:** Bias at "2 o'clock" suggests arrows consistently high-right

**Radial Consistency Index**
- Measures how evenly arrows are spread around the group center
- Value between 0 (all arrows in one spot) and 1 (perfectly even distribution)
- Context-dependent - not always "higher is better"

### Using Grouping Analysis

**Identify Aiming Issues:**
- Consistent bias in one direction → Check your aim point or sight settings
- High eccentricity horizontally → Check bow hand tension or grip
- High eccentricity vertically → Check draw length or anchor consistency

**Track Improvement:**
- Decreasing radial SD over time = improving consistency
- Decreasing eccentricity = more circular, predictable groups
- Bias moving toward center = better sight adjustment

**Compare Equipment:**
- Does a different stabilizer reduce your radial SD?
- Does a new sight decrease your bias?
- Which arrow set gives the lowest eccentricity?

> **Important:** Grouping analysis requires target face scoring with coordinates. Manual score entry doesn't capture this data.

## Fatigue Analysis

Fatigue analysis compares your performance in **early ends** vs **later ends** to identify if you're losing energy or focus during longer rounds.

### How It Works

The app divides your round into segments:
- **Early Ends** - First 1/3 of the round (e.g., Ends 1-2 in a 6-end round)
- **Later Ends** - Last 1/3 of the round (e.g., Ends 5-6 in a 6-end round)

Then calculates:
- **Average score for early ends**
- **Average score for later ends**
- **Performance drop percentage**

### Interpreting Fatigue Metrics

**Performance Drop: 0-5%**
- ✅ Excellent endurance - consistent throughout
- Your conditioning and focus are strong

**Performance Drop: 5-10%**
- ⚠️ Moderate fatigue - common for longer rounds
- Consider conditioning work or shorter practice sessions

**Performance Drop: >10%**
- ❌ Significant fatigue - impacting your scores
- Evaluate:
  - Bow weight (poundage too high?)
  - Shooting form (excessive tension?)
  - Physical conditioning
  - Mental focus techniques

### Using Fatigue Data

**Training Decisions:**
- High fatigue drop → Focus on endurance training
- Low fatigue drop → You can handle longer rounds

**Equipment Decisions:**
- High fatigue with heavy bow → Consider lower poundage limbs
- High fatigue with stabilizer weight → Try lighter weights

**Competition Strategy:**
- Know your fatigue patterns when planning tournament rounds
- Adjust pacing and rest between ends

## Consistency Analysis

Consistency metrics measure how much your scores **vary from end to end**.

### End-to-End Variation

**Standard Deviation**
- Measures score spread across ends
- Lower is better - more predictable shooting
- **Example:** SD of 3 points = most ends within 3 points of your average

**Coefficient of Variation**
- Standard deviation as a percentage of average
- Normalizes variation across different scoring levels
- Helps compare consistency at different skill levels

**Range (Best - Worst End)**
- Difference between your highest and lowest end
- Shows maximum variability
- **Example:** Range of 12 points = your worst end was 12 points below your best

### Why Consistency Matters

**In Competition:**
- Consistent shooting is more valuable than occasional high scores
- Reduces risk of "blow-up" ends that ruin your round
- Builds mental confidence

**For Improvement:**
- High variation suggests form inconsistencies
- Low variation means you've mastered your technique
- Tracking consistency over time shows skill development

### Improving Consistency

**If your end-to-end variation is high:**
- Focus on shot routine consistency
- Check equipment consistency (bow tuning, arrow spine)
- Work on mental game (staying in the moment)
- Practice at shorter distances first to build consistency

**If your consistency is good but average is low:**
- Your form is solid, work on aiming
- Consider sight adjustments
- Focus on strength and conditioning for higher draw weight

## Analytics Best Practices

### Get Accurate Data

**Use Target Face Scoring When Possible**
- Enables grouping analysis
- Provides richer data for pattern detection
- Captures information manual entry can't

**Consistently Tag Equipment**
- Always select your bow setup when creating rounds
- Update setups when you change equipment
- This keeps performance data accurate

**Complete Rounds Properly**
- Don't abandon rounds midway (skews statistics)
- Use "Pause" if you need to stop and resume later
- Only "Cancel" if the round is truly invalid

### Interpret Data Wisely

**Look for Patterns, Not Outliers**
- One bad round doesn't indicate a problem
- Track trends over 5-10 rounds minimum
- Consider external factors (weather, fatigue, time of day)

**Context Matters**
- Indoor vs outdoor performance differs
- Different distances have different scoring
- Practice rounds vs competition rounds

**Compare Apples to Apples**
- Only compare rounds at the same distance
- Use the same scoring system for comparison
- Consider target size differences

### Use Data to Improve

**Identify Weaknesses**
- Low accuracy → Work on form or aiming
- High fatigue drop → Build endurance
- High end-to-end variation → Focus on consistency
- Directional bias → Adjust sight or form

**Test Equipment Changes**
- Score baseline rounds with current setup
- Make one equipment change
- Score comparison rounds
- Analyze if the change improved performance

**Set Measurable Goals**
- "Reduce radial SD from 20mm to 15mm in 30 days"
- "Increase average score from 285 to 295 at 50m"
- "Reduce fatigue drop from 8% to 5%"
