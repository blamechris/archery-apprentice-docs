# Quick Start Guide

Welcome to Archery Apprentice! This guide will walk you through the essential features to get you scoring rounds and tracking your equipment in minutes.

## Overview

Archery Apprentice helps you:
- Track all your archery equipment (bows, arrows, sights, stabilizers, and more)
- Score rounds with flexible configurations
- Analyze your performance with detailed statistics
- Compare equipment performance over time

The typical workflow is: **Add Equipment → Create Bow Setup → Score Rounds → Analyze Performance**

---

## 1. First Launch

When you first open Archery Apprentice, you'll see the **Landing Page** with three main sections:

- **Equipment Page** - Manage your archery gear
- **Round Scoring** - Create and score rounds
- **Analytics** (coming soon) - View performance statistics

### Initial Setup

Before scoring your first round, you'll want to set up at least one bow configuration. You can skip this and add equipment later, but having a bow setup allows you to track which equipment you used for each round.

## 2. Adding Your First Equipment

### Quick Setup Path

The fastest way to start is to add the essential bow components:

**Step 1: Add a Riser**
1. Tap **Equipment Page** from the landing screen
2. Scroll to **Risers** section
3. Tap the **+** button
4. Fill in:
   - **Brand** (e.g., "Hoyt")
   - **Model** (e.g., "Formula X")
   - **Length** (e.g., "25 inches")
   - **Material** (optional)
5. Tap **Save**

**Step 2: Add Limbs**
1. Navigate to **Limbs** section
2. Tap **+** to add new limbs
3. Fill in:
   - **Brand** (e.g., "Win&Win")
   - **Model** (e.g., "Wiawis One")
   - **Poundage** (e.g., "38 lbs")
   - **Limb Length** (e.g., "Long")
4. Tap **Save**

**Step 3: Add Arrows** (Optional but recommended)
1. Navigate to **Arrows** section
2. Tap **+** to add arrow set
3. Fill in basic details:
   - **Brand/Model**
   - **Spine** (e.g., "500")
   - **Length** (e.g., "29.5 inches")
4. Tap **Save**

### Equipment Types Available

You can track these equipment types:
- **Bow Components**: Riser, Limbs, Bow String
- **Sighting**: Sight (with multiple sight marks for different distances)
- **Stabilization**: Stabilizer, Weights
- **Arrow Rest**: Plunger, Rest
- **Arrows**: Complete arrow sets with point and nock specifications

## 3. Creating a Bow Setup

A **Bow Setup** is a specific configuration of equipment you use together. You can have multiple setups (e.g., "Indoor Setup", "Outdoor 70m Setup").

**Create Your First Setup:**
1. From Equipment Page, scroll to **Bow Setups** section
2. Tap **+** to create new setup
3. Fill in:
   - **Name** (e.g., "Main Outdoor Setup")
   - **Description** (optional)
   - Select your **Riser** from the dropdown
   - Select your **Limbs** from the dropdown
   - Select additional equipment (sight, stabilizer, arrows, etc.)
4. Tap **Save**

Your bow setup is now ready to use for scoring rounds!

### Setup Versioning

When you modify equipment in a setup, the app automatically creates a new version. This lets you track performance across equipment changes without losing historical data.

## 4. Scoring Your First Round

Now you're ready to score a round!

**Step 1: Create a Round**
1. From Landing Page, tap **Round Scoring**
2. Tap **Create Round** or the **+** button
3. Configure your round:
   - **Round Name** (e.g., "Practice Session")
   - **Number of Ends** (e.g., "6")
   - **Arrows per End** (e.g., "6")
   - **Distance** (e.g., "50 meters" or "30 yards")
   - **Target Size** (e.g., "122cm" or "80cm")
   - **Scoring System** (10-ring, 6-ring, 5-zone, etc.)
   - **Bow Setup** (select the setup you created)
4. Tap **Create** or **Start Round**

**Step 2: Enter Scores**

The round is now in **IN_PROGRESS** status. For each end:

1. Enter arrow scores in order (e.g., 10, 9, 9, 8, 7, 6)
2. Mark **X-ring** hits if applicable (for tie-breaking)
3. The app automatically calculates:
   - End total
   - Running total
   - Average score
4. Tap **Next End** to continue

**Scoring Methods:**
- **Manual Entry** - Type scores directly (fastest for most archers)
- **Target Face** - Tap on target visualization to mark arrow placement (captures coordinates)
- **Quick Entry** - Streamlined input for rapid scoring

**Step 3: Complete the Round**

After scoring all ends:
1. Review your final score and statistics
2. Tap **Complete Round**
3. The round moves to **COMPLETED** status

You can now view this round in your **Historical Rounds** list!

### Multi-Participant Rounds

You can score rounds with up to **4 participants** (yourself + 3 guests):

1. When creating a round, select **Multi-Participant** mode
2. Add guest names (e.g., "John", "Sarah", "Mike")
3. During scoring, switch between participants to enter their scores
4. Each participant's scores are tracked separately

The app auto-generates temporary bow setups for guests so their equipment data is tracked without cluttering your equipment list.

## 5. Viewing Your Performance

### Round Statistics

After completing a round, you can view:
- **Total Score** and **Average per Arrow**
- **Accuracy Percentage** (based on maximum possible score)
- **X-ring Count** (important for tie-breaking)
- **10-ring Count** (or equivalent for your scoring system)
- **End-by-End Breakdown**

### Equipment Performance

Navigate to the **Equipment Analytics Hub** to see:
- **Performance by Distance** - How each bow setup performs at different ranges
- **Equipment Comparison** - Compare statistics across different setups
- **Usage History** - See when and how often you've used each setup

### Advanced Analytics

The app calculates sophisticated metrics:
- **Shot Grouping Analysis** - Consistency of arrow placement (when using target face scoring)
- **Fatigue Metrics** - Performance drop between early and late ends
- **Consistency Analysis** - End-to-end score variation
- **Performance Trends** - Improvement over time

## 6. Essential Tips

### Organizing Equipment

**Use Descriptive Names**
- ✅ Good: "Hoyt Formula X 25in", "SF Archery Sight", "Outdoor 70m Setup"
- ❌ Avoid: "Riser 1", "My Sight", "Setup A"

**Create Multiple Setups**
- Indoor vs Outdoor configurations
- Different distances (e.g., "50m Setup", "70m Setup")
- Experimental setups for testing new equipment

### Round Scoring Best Practices

**Choose the Right Scoring System**
- **10-ring** - Standard outdoor target archery (10, 9, 8... 1)
- **6-ring** - NFAA scoring (6 rings instead of 10)
- **5-zone** - Simplified scoring for practice
- **X-ring** - Compound scoring with inner 10

**Use Target Face Scoring for Analysis**
- Captures arrow coordinates for grouping analysis
- Enables advanced shot pattern visualization
- Helps identify aiming tendencies (high/low, left/right)

**Name Rounds Clearly**
- Include date, location, or purpose (e.g., "Competition Prep - May 15", "Testing New Sight")

### Data Management

**Round Status Meanings:**
- **PLANNED** - Created but not started
- **IN_PROGRESS** - Currently scoring
- **PAUSED** - Temporarily stopped (can resume later)
- **COMPLETED** - Finished scoring
- **CANCELLED** - Abandoned round

**Bow Setup Versions**
- Each time you change equipment in a setup, a new version is created
- Historical rounds always reference the exact version used
- This preserves accurate equipment performance data
