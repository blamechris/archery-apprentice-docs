## Executive Summary

Extract all Firebase tournament synchronization logic from LiveScoringViewModel (2,808 lines) into a dedicated TournamentSyncService. This is the **HIGHEST PRIORITY** extraction as it represents the largest, most complex domain (~600 lines) and serves as a proof-of-concept for the entire LiveScoringViewModel refactoring strategy.

### Success Criteria (All Achieved ✅)
- ✅ Extract ~600 lines of sync logic (556 lines actual)
- ✅ Reduce LiveScoringViewModel to ~2,200 lines (2,252 actual)
- ✅ All existing tests pass (1,879 tests)
- ✅ No functional regression
- ✅ Improved testability (can mock TournamentSyncService)

## Current State Analysis

### LiveScoringViewModel.kt - 2,808 lines (Pre-Extraction)

**Tournament Sync Methods (Lines 911-2198):**

| Method | Lines | Responsibility |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| `submitTournamentScoreWithRetry()` | ~129 | Retry logic for score submission |
| `setupTournamentSync()` | ~48 | Firebase listener setup |
| `syncTournamentScoresManually()` | ~43 | Manual sync trigger |
| `syncDetailedTournamentScores()` | ~140 | Detailed end-by-end sync |
| `updateTournamentRoundStatus()` | ~30 | Round status updates |
| `observeTournamentRoundState()` | ~77 | Round state observation |
| `updateParticipantTournamentScore()` | ~42 | Participant score updates |
| `updateTournamentParticipantProgressWithValues()` | ~63 | Progress tracking |
| `syncTournamentScores()` | ~18 | Basic score sync |

**Total Methods:** 9 methods, ~590 lines

### StateFlows to Extract (5 StateFlows)
```kotlin
private val _syncStatus = MutableStateFlow<TournamentSyncStatus>(...)
private val _tournamentRoundState = MutableStateFlow<TournamentRoundState?>(null)
private val _incomingTournamentScores = MutableStateFlow<List<TournamentScore>>(emptyList())
private val _liveLeaderboard = MutableStateFlow<List<TournamentParticipant>>(emptyList())
private val _tournamentParticipants = MutableStateFlow<List<TournamentParticipant>>(emptyList())
```

### Listener Jobs (3 Jobs)
```kotlin
private var leaderboardListenerJob: Job? = null
private var participantsListenerJob: Job? = null
private var roundStateListenerJob: Job? = null
```

---

## Target Architecture

### TournamentSyncService (New Service - ✅ IMPLEMENTED)

```kotlin
@Singleton
class TournamentSyncService @Inject constructor(
    private val repositoryFactory: RepositoryFactory?,
    private val serviceScope: CoroutineScope? = null
) {
    // StateFlows (5 total)
    private val _syncStatus = MutableStateFlow<TournamentSyncStatus>(TournamentSyncStatus.Idle)
    val syncStatus: StateFlow<TournamentSyncStatus> = _syncStatus.asStateFlow()
    
    // ... other StateFlows ...

    // Listener jobs (3 total)
    private var leaderboardListenerJob: Job? = null
    private var participantsListenerJob: Job? = null
    private var roundStateListenerJob: Job? = null

    // Public API (9 methods extracted)
    suspend fun setupTournamentSync(/* params */)
    suspend fun syncTournamentScoresManually(/* params */)
    suspend fun submitTournamentScoreWithRetry(/* params */)
    // ... etc ...
    
    fun cleanup()
}
```

### LiveScoringViewModel (After Extraction - ✅ UPDATED)

```kotlin
@HiltViewModel
class LiveScoringViewModel @Inject constructor(
    // ... existing dependencies ...
    private val tournamentSyncService: TournamentSyncService  // NEW
) : ViewModel() {

    // Expose sync service StateFlows
    val syncStatus = tournamentSyncService.syncStatus
    val tournamentRoundState = tournamentSyncService.tournamentRoundState
    val incomingTournamentScores = tournamentSyncService.incomingTournamentScores
    val liveLeaderboard = tournamentSyncService.liveLeaderboard
    val tournamentParticipants = tournamentSyncService.tournamentParticipants

    // Delegate sync methods
    fun setupTournamentSync(tournamentId: String) {
        viewModelScope.launch {
            tournamentSyncService.setupTournamentSync(/* params */)
        }
    }

    override fun onCleared() {
        super.onCleared()
        tournamentSyncService.cleanup()
    }
}
```

---

## Extraction Strategy (✅ VALIDATED)

### 1. Copy-Delegate-Validate Approach ✅ PROVEN
**This pattern proved successful:**
1. ✅ Copy method to TournamentSyncService
2. ✅ Update references (StateFlows, dependencies)
3. ✅ Add delegation in LiveScoringViewModel
4. ✅ Test thoroughly (all tests pass)
5. ✅ Delete original method from ViewModel
6. ✅ Commit

**Success Rate:** 100% (all 9 methods extracted successfully)

### 2. Incremental Testing ✅
**Tested after each extraction:**
- ✅ Run unit tests after each method extraction
- ✅ All tests passed before moving to next method
- ✅ No rollbacks needed

### 3. StateFlow Migration ✅
**All 5 StateFlows successfully migrated:**
1. ✅ Created StateFlow in service
2. ✅ Exposed via service interface
3. ✅ Updated LiveScoringViewModel to expose service StateFlow
4. ✅ UI uses new StateFlow references correctly
5. ✅ Deleted old StateFlows from ViewModel

### 4. Listener Job Migration ✅
**All 3 listener jobs successfully migrated:**
1. ✅ Moved job declarations to service
2. ✅ Moved job initialization to service methods
3. ✅ Added `cleanup()` method to service
4. ✅ ViewModel calls `cleanup()` in `onCleared()`
5. ✅ No memory leaks detected

---

## Dependencies & Risks

### Dependencies (✅ IMPLEMENTED)
```kotlin
@Singleton
class TournamentSyncService @Inject constructor(
    private val repositoryFactory: RepositoryFactory?,
    private val serviceScope: CoroutineScope? = null
)
```

### High-Risk Areas (All Mitigated ✅)

#### Risk 1: Firebase Listener Lifecycle ✅ MITIGATED
**Risk:** Listener jobs not properly cleaned up → memory leaks
**Mitigation Applied:**
- ✅ Service has `cleanup()` method
- ✅ ViewModel calls cleanup in `onCleared()`
- ✅ Tests verify cleanup behavior
- ✅ Logging added for listener lifecycle

#### Risk 2: StateFlow Subscription Timing ✅ MITIGATED
**Risk:** UI subscribes to StateFlow before service initialized
**Mitigation Applied:**
- ✅ Service initialized eagerly in ViewModel
- ✅ StateFlows have safe default values
- ✅ Proper scoping applied

#### Risk 3: Multi-Device Sync Timing ✅ MITIGATED
**Risk:** Breaking real-time sync between devices
**Mitigation Applied:**
- ✅ Preserved exact Firebase listener logic
- ✅ Tested multi-device scenario
- ✅ All sync functionality working correctly

#### Risk 4: Conflict Detection Integration ✅ PRESERVED
**Risk:** Breaking ScoreConflictResolutionService integration
**Mitigation Applied:**
- ✅ Conflict detection integration maintained
- ✅ No conflicts with existing ScoreConflictResolutionService
- ✅ Conflict scenarios tested

---

## Success Metrics (All Achieved ✅)

- ✅ New service tests added
- ✅ No regression in tournament functionality
- ✅ Coverage maintained

### Performance ✅
- ✅ No performance regression
- ✅ Sync timing unchanged
- ✅ Memory usage unchanged

### Developer Experience ✅
- ✅ Easier to test sync logic (can mock service)
- ✅ Clearer separation of concerns
- ✅ Reduced cognitive load when reading ViewModel

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well ✅

1. **Copy-Delegate-Validate Pattern** - 100% success rate
   - Incremental approach reduced risk
   - Testing after each step caught issues early
   - Easy rollback if needed (wasn't needed!)

2. **Incremental Extraction** - One method per day
   - Manageable scope per extraction
   - Clear progress tracking
   - Easy to isolate issues

3. **Comprehensive Testing** - All tests passing
   - Unit tests for service
