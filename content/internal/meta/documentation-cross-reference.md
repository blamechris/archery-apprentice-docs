# Documentation Cross-Reference Index

**Purpose:** This index maps documentation between the Git repository (`docs/`) and the Obsidian vault to maintain consistency and prevent duplication.

**Last Updated:** October 15, 2025 (Session 2)

## Documentation Strategy

### Git Repository (docs/)
- **Purpose:** Official project documentation checked into version control
- **Audience:** Developers, contributors, CI/CD systems
- **Format:** Markdown files with clear structure and cross-references
- **Location:** `archery-apprentice/docs/`

### Obsidian Vault
- **Purpose:** Rich interconnected knowledge base with advanced linking
- **Audience:** Development team, detailed technical research
- **Format:** Markdown with Obsidian-specific features (wiki links, tags, backlinks)
- **Location:** `ArcheryApprentice-Docs/`

## Maintenance Guidelines

### When Adding New Documentation

1. **Decide on Location:**
   - **Git (docs/)**: Official specs, completion reports, roadmaps, contributing guides
   - **Obsidian**: Detailed flows, technical research, interconnected notes, daily journals

2. **Update This Index:**
   - Add entry to appropriate section
   - Mark status (✅ Synced, 📝 Git only, 📝 Vault only, 📦 Archived)
   - Include file paths for both locations if synced

3. **Prevent Duplication:**
   - Check this index before creating new documentation
   - If content exists elsewhere, add cross-reference instead of duplicating
   - Archive completed work to `COLD_STORAGE/` rather than deleting

### Sync Patterns

**✅ Synced Content:**
- Architecture overviews (high-level design docs)
- Refactoring status and roadmaps
- Project journals and implementation status
- Contributing guides

**📝 Git Only:**
- Official roadmaps (V2_RELEASE_ROADMAP)
- Release plans and E2E testing plans
- Phase completion reports
- README files with project structure

**📝 Vault Only:**
- Detailed technical flows (Equipment, Round Lifecycle, Scoring)
- Service architecture deep dives
- Daily development journals
- Test quality standards and guides
- Current TODO and work-in-progress tracking
- **Technical notes** (Firebase auth, ranking algorithms, entity mapping)

**📦 Archived:**
- Completed extraction plans
- Outdated planning documents
- Historical session summaries
- Superseded architecture audits

### Quarterly Review Checklist

- [ ] Check for duplicate content between Git and Vault
- [ ] Archive completed phase documentation to COLD_STORAGE
- [ ] Update this cross-reference index
- [ ] Verify file paths are correct
- [ ] Consolidate scattered notes into appropriate directories
- [ ] Update dates in README files

**Recommendation:** Keep this index updated when adding new documentation. Use it as a reference to prevent duplication and maintain clear separation of concerns between Git repository (official specs) and Obsidian vault (detailed research and daily work).

**Recent Update (Oct 15, 2025 - Session 2):** Added 3 new documentation files for multi-participant ranking display implementation. All documentation follows standardized templates and includes comprehensive technical details, test coverage, and architectural decisions.
