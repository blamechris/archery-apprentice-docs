# Development Sessions

This directory contains detailed session notes and daily journals documenting development work on the Archery Apprentice project.

## Purpose

Development session notes provide comprehensive records of:
- Features implemented
- Bugs fixed
- Technical decisions made
- Test coverage improvements
- Architecture refactoring progress
- Lessons learned

## Naming Convention

Session notes follow consistent naming patterns:
- **Date-based**: `YYYY-MM-DD-descriptive-title.md` (e.g., `2025-10-09-test-coverage-lifecycle-fixes.md`)
- **Feature-based**: `Feature Name.md` for multi-session features (e.g., `Tournament Settings and Display Names Fix.md`)
- **Daily journals**: `YYYY-MM-DD-daily-journal.md` for comprehensive daily summaries

- Continue using date-based naming for single-session work
- Use feature-based naming for multi-session features
- Daily journals for comprehensive summaries spanning multiple areas
