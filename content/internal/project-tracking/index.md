# Project Tracking

Internal project status tracking, implementation journals, TODO lists, and progress snapshots.

**Purpose:** This section contains real-time project tracking documents that capture development progress, implementation status, and active task lists.

**Audience:** Project maintainers, autonomous agents, and development team

## Tracking Philosophy

This section follows an **evidence-based progress tracking** approach:

1. **Timestamped Snapshots** - Regular status captures preserve historical context
2. **Active TODO Management** - Single source of truth for current priorities
3. **Journal-Style Logging** - Narrative context for technical decisions
4. **Checkpoint Reviews** - Periodic comprehensive assessments

## Relationship to Other Documentation

- **[KMP Migration](../kmp-migration/)** - Project-specific migration tracking
- **[Retrospectives](../retrospectives/)** - Lessons learned and process improvements
- **[Analysis](../analysis/)** - Technical analysis informing tracking decisions

---

## Archive Policy

Status snapshots older than 3 months are candidates for archiving. Active tracking documents (Current TODO, ViewModel Progress) are continuously updated.
