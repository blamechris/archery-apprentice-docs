# Current TODO List & Project Status
**Last Updated:** October 4, 2025
**Current Phase:** Phase 3 - Cache Monitoring + Phase 5.2 Polish

---

## Recent Accomplishments (Since Sept 30, 2025)

### Phase 2: Smart Caching System - COMPLETE âœ…
- **5-10x faster load times** for cached tournament data
- **50-90% reduction** in Firestore reads
- **100% cache hit rate** validated on second load
- **Feature flags enabled** for safe production deployment
- **Automatic cache maintenance** working correctly

### Critical Bug Fixes - COMPLETE âœ…
- âœ… **Round completion sync**: Network devices now see completion status properly
- âœ… **Score summary data**: Completed rounds display correct scores
- âœ… **Guest ownership indicators**: Only owner sees "Yours" badge
- âœ… **Non-participant viewing**: Tournament results accessible to all users
- âœ… **Navigation loops**: Clean back button behavior implemented

---

## Current Project State

### What's Working Perfectly âœ…
- Real-time score synchronization across devices (1-2 second latency)
- Multi-device concurrent scoring (no conflicts or data loss)
- Guest participant synchronization
- Offline score queueing and background sync
- Live leaderboard with animations and highlighting
- Network status indicators
- Firebase transaction-based atomic updates
- Smart caching with status-aware TTL
- Round completion status propagation
- Guest ownership indicators
- Non-participant tournament viewing

### What Needs Attention ðŸ”§
- **Leaderboard sorting consistency** - Needs review across devices
- **Firestore cascade delete** - Orphaned data cleanup
- **Average score calculation** - Shows 0.0 in some cases
- Several UX polish items cataloged below

---

## CURRENT TODO LIST

### ðŸ”´ HIGH PRIORITY (Next 1-2 Sessions)

#### 1. Review Leaderboard Sorting Consistency Across Devices
**Priority:** HIGH | **Effort:** 0.5-1 session | **Status:** Needs verification

**Current Behavior:**
- User reports potential inconsistency in sort order across devices
- Need to verify if issue still exists after recent fixes

**Expected Behavior:**
- All participants sorted by score (highest to lowest) on all devices
- Consistent ordering regardless of which device is viewing
- Optional: Outline/highlight for local (scorable) participants

**Technical Details:**
- **Impact:** High if confirmed - breaks fair competition display
- **Files to investigate:**
  - Leaderboard UI component (sorting logic)
  - Participant list rendering
  - Score-based sorting implementation
- **Action:** Test multi-device scenario first, then fix if needed

---

#### 2. Implement Firestore Cascade Delete for Rounds
**Priority:** HIGH | **Effort:** 0.5 session | **Status:** Not started

**Current Behavior:**
- Deleting a round doesn't remove the Firestore subcollection entry
- Firebase data accumulates as orphaned entries
- Potential cost implications with growing data

**Expected Behavior:**
- When creator deletes round, all Firebase data removed
- Subcollections cleaned up (scores, ends, participant progress)
- No orphaned data remaining

**Technical Details:**
- **Impact:** High - Firebase cost, data hygiene, potential bugs
- **Files to investigate:**
  - `FirebaseTournamentRepository.kt` - delete operations
  - `HybridTournamentRepository.kt` - orchestration
  - Round deletion flow
- **Implementation:** Recursive subcollection delete or batch operation

---

### ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM PRIORITY (UX & Polish - 2-3 Sessions)

#### 3. Fix Average Score Calculation Showing 0.0
**Priority:** MEDIUM | **Effort:** 0.5 session

**Current Behavior:**
- "Avg" field on LiveLeaderboardCard displays 0.0 for some participants
- Averages not calculated or not displayed in all cases

**Expected Behavior:**
- Calculate and display average score per end
- Show accurate average for each participant
- Update in real-time as scores are submitted

**Technical Details:**
- **Files to investigate:**
  - `LeaderboardEntry.kt` - data model
  - Leaderboard calculation/aggregation logic
- **Calculation:** Total score Ã· number of ends completed

---

#### 4. Lock Network Participant Selection to Prevent Orphaning User
**Priority:** MEDIUM | **Effort:** 0.5 session

**Current Behavior:**
- Tapping a non-local participant may deselect current participant
- User left unable to score (no participant selected)

**Expected Behavior:**
- Disable tap interaction for network participants (non-scorable)
- Add TODO comment for future stats feature
- User maintains their scoring context

---

#### 5. Fix Participant Indicator (*) Showing for All Participants
**Priority:** MEDIUM | **Effort:** 0.5 session

**Current Behavior:**
- All participant cards display * indicator
- No distinction between local and network participants

**Expected Behavior:**
- Only local participants (scorable on this device) should show *
- Network participants should not show indicator
- Clear visual distinction of who can be scored

---

#### 6. Improve 3-Letter Name Truncation Disambiguation
**Priority:** MEDIUM | **Effort:** 0.5 session

**Current Behavior:**
- Names truncated to 3 letters
- Creates ambiguity: "GUE" for both "Guest" and "Guest2"

**Expected Behavior:**
- Better disambiguation strategy for similar names
- Options:
  - Use numbers when collision detected (GU1, GU2)
  - Show more characters when names collide
  - Full name with ellipsis for long names

---

#### 7. Fix Completed Rounds Vanishing from Tournament Discovery
**Priority:** MEDIUM | **Effort:** 0.5 session

**Current Behavior:**
- When round is completed, it may disappear from tournament list
- Users lose easy access to completed tournament data

**Expected Behavior:**
- Move completed rounds to separate "Completed" tab
- Don't hide rounds automatically
- Only hide when explicitly deleted by user

---

### ðŸŸ¢ LOW PRIORITY (Future Enhancement)

#### 8. LiveLeaderboardCard Scrollability
**Priority:** LOW | **Effort:** 0.5 session

**Current Behavior:**
- LiveLeaderboardCard may extend infinitely downward with many participants
- No maximum height constraint

**Expected Behavior:**
- Show maximum 5 participants in card
- Require vertical scroll for additional participants
- Maintain compact, manageable UI

---

### ðŸ”µ PHASE 3: CACHE MONITORING (Next Week)

#### 9. Production Cache Metrics Monitoring
**Priority:** HIGH | **Effort:** 1 week observation

**Monitoring Tasks:**
- Track cache hit rates across diverse tournaments (target: >70%)
- Validate no memory leaks or performance issues
- Analyze Firestore read reduction in real usage (expecting 50-90%)
- Tune TTL settings if needed based on user behavior
- Consider adding manual refresh UI (pull-to-refresh gesture)

**Success Criteria:**
- âœ… Cache hit rate >70% across diverse tournaments
- âœ… Memory usage stable, no leaks
- âœ… Firestore costs reduced by 50-90%
- âœ… Consistent 5-10x performance improvement
- âœ… No user complaints about stale data

---

### ðŸ”µ DEFERRED (Future Sessions)

#### 10. Validate Offline â†’ Online Transition Behavior
**Priority:** DEFERRED | **Effort:** 1 session

**Scope:**
- Test score sync when device comes back online
- Validate queued scores are submitted correctly
- Verify no data loss during transition
- Test multiple devices going offline/online

---

#### 11. Test Conflict Resolution Edge Cases and Performance
**Priority:** DEFERRED | **Effort:** 1 session

**Scope:**
- Test simultaneous end completion from multiple devices
- Validate with 10+ concurrent participants
- Performance testing under load
- Edge case scenario validation

---

### ðŸ§¹ CLEANUP

#### 12. Remove Debug Log Markers from Tournament Sync Code
**Priority:** LOW (after validation) | **Effort:** 0.5 session

**Scope:**
- Remove or reduce verbose diagnostic logging added during development
- Keep essential error logging
- Clean up temporary debug markers (ðŸ“¸, ðŸ”„, âœ…, etc.)
- Production-ready logging levels

**Files with debug logging:**
- `LiveScoringViewModel.kt` - RecordEndCompletion, ParticipantProgress tags
- `FirebaseTournamentRepository.kt` - TournamentScoreSync, detailed logs
- `HybridTournamentRepository.kt` - various sync operation logs
