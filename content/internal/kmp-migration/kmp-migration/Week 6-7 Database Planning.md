# Week 6-7: Database Migration Planning & Pattern 3 Review

**Period:** October 21-26, 2025
**Agent:** Agent 2 (AAM - Architecture, Android, Multi-platform)
**Status:** âœ… COMPLETE

---

## Overview

Week 6-7 focused on two critical deliverables:
1. **Week 6:** Create comprehensive entity migration execution plan for Week 9-10
2. **Week 7:** Review Agent 1's Pattern 3 implementation (Context Abstraction)

**Strategic Goal:** Make Week 9-10 entity migration "paint by numbers" through detailed planning and ensure Pattern 3 quality for Week 8 service migrations.

---

## Week 6: Entity Migration Execution Plan

### Objective
Create a comprehensive execution plan for migrating 17 Room entities from `app` module to `shared:database` with kotlinx.serialization support.

### Deliverable
**PR #150:** Added Phase 1 section to DATABASE_MIGRATION_PLAN.md (+789 lines)

**Key Components:**
1. **Entity Inventory (22 total)**
   - âœ… 5 already migrated to shared:domain
   - ðŸŽ¯ 17 to migrate in Week 9-10

2. **Migration Tracker Table (23 rows)**
   - Entity name
   - Current location
   - Target location
   - Android dependencies identified
   - Migration complexity
   - Estimated effort

3. **Daily Breakdown (Week 9-10)**
   - Day 1-3: kotlinx.serialization migration (Agent 2 lead)
   - Day 4-5: Simple entities (7 entities, ~2 hours)
   - Day 6-8: Medium entities (6 entities, ~3 hours)
   - Day 9-10: Complex entities (4 entities, ~1 hour)

4. **Migration Patterns (4 documented)**
   - Pattern 1: Simple entity (just add @Serializable)
   - Pattern 2: Dateâ†’Long conversion
   - Pattern 3: Enum handling
   - Pattern 4: Foreign key relationships

5. **Testing Strategy**
   - Incremental: Test each entity after migration
   - Daily: End-of-day smoke tests
   - Comprehensive: Final validation suite

### Key Findings

**Android Dependency Analysis:**
- âœ… Only 1 entity needs conversion: `ArrowEquipmentSnapshot`
  - Uses `java.util.Date` at line 57
  - Migration: `capturedAt: Date` â†’ `capturedAt: Long`
- âœ… 16/17 entities are KMP-ready (just need @Serializable)

**Complexity Assessment:**
- Simple (7 entities): ~15 min each = 2 hours
- Medium (6 entities): ~30 min each = 3 hours
- Complex (4 entities): ~15 min each = 1 hour
- **Total:** ~6 hours for 17 entities

### Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge 1: Merge Conflict**
- **Issue:** DATABASE_MIGRATION_PLAN.md had 6 PRs merged since branch creation
- **Conflict:** Both my Section 7 (Phase 1 plan) and main's Section 7 (Risks) at different lines
- **Solution:** Kept both sections, renumbered main's Section 7â†’8, updated all subsequent sections (8â†’9, 9â†’10, etc.)
- **Outcome:** Clean merge with all 14 sections properly numbered

**Challenge 2: Git Worktree**
- **Issue:** `git checkout main` failed (main branch used by another worktree)
- **Solution:** Used `git pull origin main` directly (worked despite worktree)
- **Learning:** Can pull from remote without checking out branch locally

**Challenge 3: Uncommitted local.properties**
- **Issue:** Machine-specific SDK path changes in local.properties
- **Solution:** `git restore local.properties` to discard
- **Prevention:** Confirmed local.properties in .gitignore

### Files Changed
- `docs/kmp-migration/DATABASE_MIGRATION_PLAN.md` (+789 lines, now 2,109 total)
  - Section 7: Phase 1 Entity Migration Execution Plan
  - Entity inventory table
  - Week 9-10 daily breakdown
  - Migration patterns with code examples
  - Testing strategy

### Impact
- âœ… Week 9-10 is now "paint by numbers" (~6 hours for 17 entities)
- âœ… Migration patterns documented for team reference
- âœ… Android dependencies de-risked (only 1/17 needs conversion)

## Week 7: Pattern 3 PR Review

### Objective
Comprehensive review of Agent 1's Pattern 3 implementation before merge.

### Deliverable
**PR #152 Review:** APPROVED with EXCELLENT rating across all criteria

**PR Details:**
- 12 new files
- ~1,900 lines of code
- 57 tests (53 production + 4 fake implementations)

### Review Methodology

**6-Point Comprehensive Review (3 hours):**

1. **Interface Design Quality (30 min)** - âœ… EXCELLENT
   - Read all 3 interfaces: FileSystemProvider, PreferenceStorage, ResourceProvider
   - Verified suspend functions for async operations
   - Confirmed platform-agnostic signatures

2. **Android Implementation Quality (45 min)** - âœ… EXCELLENT
   - Reviewed AndroidFileSystemProvider, AndroidPreferenceStorage, AndroidResourceProvider
   - Validated Dispatchers.IO usage for I/O operations
   - Checked proper Android context handling

3. **Test Fake Quality (30 min)** - âœ… EXCELLENT
   - Examined FakeFileSystemProvider, FakePreferenceStorage, FakeResourceProvider
   - Verified in-memory storage for test isolation
   - Confirmed thread-safe implementations

4. **Test Coverage Quality (45 min)** - âœ… EXCELLENT
   - Counted and categorized all 57 tests
   - Verified edge cases covered (empty strings, null handling, concurrency)
   - Validated error scenarios tested

5. **Build & Integration (30 min)** - âœ… EXCELLENT
   - Ran builds: All passed
   - Ran tests: 100% pass rate
   - No compilation warnings

6. **Documentation Quality (15 min)** - âœ… EXCELLENT
   - Reviewed KDoc for all interfaces
   - Verified usage examples
   - Confirmed migration guide clarity

### Key Architectural Strengths

**Pattern 3: Context Abstraction**
- Platform-agnostic interfaces for Android context dependencies

## Week 6-7 Combined Impact

### Strategic Achievements
1. **Week 9-10 Planning Complete**

   - Effort estimated at ~6 hours for 17 entities
   - Migration patterns documented
   - Risk de-escalated (only 1 Android dependency)

2. **Pattern 3 Validated**
   - Comprehensive review completed
   - Quality confirmed across 6 dimensions

- âœ… 58% ahead of schedule (cumulative)

### Lessons Learned

**Git Workflow:**

- Worktree conflicts can be bypassed with direct remote pulls
- Always check for uncommitted machine-specific files (local.properties)

**Planning Approach:**
- Incremental entity analysis (sample first, then comprehensive)
- Daily breakdown creates actionable tasks
- Code examples in documentation reduce implementation time

**Review Methodology:**
- 6-point checklist ensures thorough evaluation
- Running builds/tests validates integration
- Time-boxed review prevents scope creep (3 hours total)
