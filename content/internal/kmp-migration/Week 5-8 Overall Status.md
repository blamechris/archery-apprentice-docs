## Coordination Patterns

### Daily Standup Pattern

**Morning Check-In (9 AM):**
- Status: What did you complete yesterday?
- Today: What will you work on today?
- Blockers: Do you need help with anything?

**Evening Wrap-Up (5 PM):**
- Completed: What did you finish today?
- Next: What's your next task?
- PRs: Any PRs ready for review?

### PR Review Pattern

**Reviewers:**
- Agent 2 reviews architecture and patterns
- Agent 3 reviews test coverage
- Agent O reviews orchestration impact
- User final approval and merge

**Review Checklist:**
- [ ] Interface design clear
- [ ] Implementation follows best practices
- [ ] Test coverage ≥ 90%
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] Build passes
- [ ] No regressions

### Session Wrap-Up Pattern

**Process (tonight's implementation):**
1. Each agent updates context file (Session Resume Point)
2. Each agent creates Obsidian PR (work summary)
3. Result: 8 PRs (4 context + 4 Obsidian)
4. Tomorrow: Merge all 8 PRs, resume fresh session

**Benefits:**
- Clean session end/resume
- Clear audit trail (8 separate PRs)
- Easy session resumption (Session Resume Points)

## Quality Metrics

### PR Merge Success
- 7 PRs merged: #144, #149, #150, #151, #152, #153, #154 (pending)
- 1 merge conflict (PR #150, resolved)
- 0 PRs rejected or reverted
- 100% merge success rate

### Test Suite Health
- All tests passing (2051+ tests)
- Coverage: 81% → 84-85% (+3-4%)
- 0 regressions introduced
- Test execution: stable (~90s)

### Agent Task Completion
- Agent 1: 100% (Week 7-8 goals met)
- Agent 2: 100% (Week 6-7 goals met)
- Agent 3: 100% (Week 7-8 goals met)
- Overall: 100% completion rate

### Velocity Metrics
- Week 5: 1 PR merged
- Week 6: 2 PRs merged
- Week 7: 2 PRs merged
- Week 8: 2 PRs merged
- Average: 2 PRs/week (consistent)

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

1. **Session Resume Points**
   - Clean session end/resume pattern
   - Easy to pick up where we left off
   - No context loss between sessions

2. **Parallel Work**
   - 3 agents working simultaneously
   - No conflicts (separate work streams)
   - Faster overall progress

3. **Cross-Agent Reviews**
   - Agents reviewing each other
   - High quality (multiple perspectives)
   - Shared knowledge across agents

4. **Documentation First**
   - Planning before implementation
   - No rework needed
   - Clear roadmap (Week 9-10)

### What Could Improve

1. **PR Merge Timing**
   - Some PRs sat for 24+ hours
   - Could merge faster (same day)
   - Faster feedback loop

2. **Dependency Tracking**
   - Manual tracking of cross-agent dependencies
   - Could use better tools (dependency matrix)
   - Prevent blocking scenarios

3. **Automation**
   - Session wrap-up is manual (8 PRs)
   - Could automate (script for PR creation)
   - Save time on repetitive tasks

### Week 9 Adjustments

1. **Daily Merges:** Merge PRs same day (faster feedback)
2. **Dependency Matrix:** Track Agent 1 ↔ Agent 2 ↔ Agent 3 dependencies explicitly
3. **Automated Wrap-Up:** Consider script for session wrap-up PRs
