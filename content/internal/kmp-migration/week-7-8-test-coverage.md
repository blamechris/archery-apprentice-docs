   - Expired cache detection (TTL validation)
   - Cache timestamp retrieval (most recent cachedAt)

5. **CLEANUP OPERATIONS (3 tests)**
   - Expired cache deletion (respects COMPLETED status - never expires)
   - Tournament cache deletion (removes all cache for tournament)
   - Clear all cache (deletes everything)

6. **CACHE STATISTICS (2 tests)**
   - Total entry count
   - Count by tournament status (IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETED, etc.)

**Impact:**
- Validates database layer reliability
- Tests query performance with realistic data volumes
- Ensures data integrity constraints work (TTL, soft deletion, status filtering)

## Cross-Agent Collaboration

### Agent 1 (AAP) - Pattern 3 Review

**PR Reviewed:** #152 (Pattern 3 core abstractions)

**Review Findings:**
- Test coverage: 95%+ for all abstractions ✅
- Test quality: Excellent (fakes, error cases, edge cases) ✅
- No concerns raised, PR approved

**Notes:**
- PreferenceStorage tests: 18 tests (comprehensive)
- ResourceProvider tests: 12 tests (covers all resource types)

## Testing Patterns Established

### ViewModel Testing Pattern

```kotlin
// 1. Test lifecycle
@Test fun `initialization sets correct initial state`()
@Test fun `cleanup releases resources on disposal`()

// 2. Test state management
@Test fun `loading state shows during data fetch`()
@Test fun `success state updates UI with data`()
@Test fun `error state shows message to user`()

// 3. Test error handling
@Test fun `network failure triggers retry logic`()
@Test fun `timeout recovers gracefully`()
```

### DAO Testing Pattern

```kotlin
// 1. Test CRUD operations
@Test fun `insert creates new row`()
@Test fun `update modifies existing row`()
@Test fun `delete removes row`()

// 2. Test queries
@Test fun `filter by ID returns correct row`()
@Test fun `sort by field orders results`()

// 3. Test data integrity
@Test fun `unique constraint prevents duplicates`()
@Test fun `foreign key enforces referential integrity`()
```

### Utils Testing Pattern

```kotlin
// 1. Test validation
@Test fun `empty input returns default`()
@Test fun `invalid input throws exception`()

// 2. Test localization
@Test fun `resource lookup works for all locales`()
@Test fun `fallback to default locale on error`()

// 3. Test formatting
@Test fun `format handles edge cases`()
```

- No slow tests identified (all <1s per test)

### Test Quality Indicators

- Test-to-code ratio: 1:1.5 (healthy balance)
- Coverage for new code: 85%+ (prevents regressions)
- Test failures during development: 0 (high quality first-time)

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

1. **Prioritization**: P0 tasks first (high value, low effort)
2. **Incremental**: Small PRs (40-65 tests each) for fast review
3. **Patterns**: Reusable test structures (ViewModel, DAO, Utils)

### What Could Improve

1. **Automation**: Could use code generation for boilerplate tests
2. **Coverage Goals**: Should set per-package targets (not just project-level)
3. **Documentation**: Test documentation could be more comprehensive

### Week 9 Adjustments

- Focus on validation support (not new test additions)
- Expect coverage dips during entity migration (temporary)
- Prioritize fixing failures over adding new tests

## Week 9 Preview: Validation Support

**Role:** Support Agent 2's entity migration validation

### Expected Work

**Days 1-3 (kotlinx.serialization migration):**
- Monitor build for test failures
- Fix imports if serialization changes data classes
- Maintain coverage (expect minor dips during refactoring)

**Days 4-5 (entity migration):**
- Fix ~40 tests with data model changes
- Update mocks for new KMP-compatible entities
- Validate coverage stays 82%+ (prevent regressions)

**Continuous:**
- Review any new Pattern 3 PRs for test impacts
- Add tests for any new KMP abstractions
- Support Agent O's orchestration (report daily status)

### Success Criteria

- All tests passing after entity migration (2090+ tests)
- Coverage maintained or improved (82%+ → 83%+)
- No regressions introduced by database changes
- Week 9 validation complete by Friday
