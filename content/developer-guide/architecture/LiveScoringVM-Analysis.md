**Total Tournament Features:** ~1,300 lines (123% of baseline!)

**No refactoring between phases!**

## Extraction Strategy Applied

### Copy-Delegate-Validate Pattern (Proven 4/4 times)

**Phase 1: Copy**
- Extract service interface and implementation
- Copy methods and StateFlows to new service
- Maintain original code in ViewModel

**Phase 2: Delegate**
- ViewModel delegates to service via dependency injection
- Route UI calls through service methods
- Expose service StateFlows directly

**Phase 3: Validate**
- Run full test suite
- Verify no functionality regression
- Remove original code only after validation

**Success Rate:** 100% (4/4 extractions successful)

## Remaining Work (1-2 Weeks)

### Priority 4: TournamentRoundLifecycleService (~200 lines, 3 days)
**Extract:**
- Round initialization logic
- Completion handling
- State transition management

**Benefits:**
- Clear lifecycle management boundary
- Easier testing of round states
- Reduced ViewModel complexity

### Priority 5: StatisticsAggregationService (~150 lines, 2 days)
**Extract:**
- Real-time stats calculation
- Leaderboard entry building
- Trend detection

**Benefits:**
- Isolated statistics logic
- Performance optimization opportunities
- Independent testing

### Final Cleanup (3 days)
- Consolidate remaining StateFlows
- Remove any remaining dead code
- Optimize method organization
- Validate final line count target

## Comparison to RoundViewModel Situation

### Key Differences:
1. ❌ RoundViewModel: **3 planning docs, ZERO work done**
2. ✅ LiveScoringViewModel: **EXECUTING - 68% complete!**

### Critical Lesson:
**EXECUTION > PLANNING**

LiveScoringViewModel proved the approach works - **execute incrementally, one service at a time**.

---

## Timeline to Completion

**Week 1-2 (Oct 5-6):** ✅ TournamentSyncService, ScoreConflictResolutionService - COMPLETE
**Week 3 (Oct 6):** ✅ EndCompletionService - COMPLETE  
**Week 4 (Oct 9):** ✅ StateFlow Delegation - COMPLETE
**Week 5 (TODO):** 🔲 TournamentRoundLifecycleService + StatisticsAggregationService
**Week 6 (TODO):** 🔲 Final cleanup and validation

**Expected Completion:** Mid-October 2025
**Current Progress:** 68% (ahead of schedule)

---

## Conclusion

LiveScoringViewModel's 60% growth represents a **maintainability crisis** requiring immediate intervention. The explosive growth from tournament feature additions (Phases 2.2-4.1) created a 12-domain god class spanning 2,808 lines.

**Progress Update (Oct 9):**
- **Extracted:** 1,363 lines (49% of peak)
- **Current Size:** 2,134 lines (24% reduction)
- **Completion:** 68% (4/6 extractions done)
- **Remaining:** 2 services (~350 lines)

**Key Difference from RoundViewModel:**
- RoundViewModel: **Planned but never executed**
- LiveScoringViewModel: ✅ **EXECUTING - 68% complete with proven pattern**

**Timeline:** 1-2 weeks to complete remaining extractions and reach ~1,900 line target.

**Risk Level:** LOW - Proven extraction pattern with 100% success rate (4/4)

**Business Impact:** HIGH - Prevents technical debt from blocking future tournament features and multi-device enhancements.
