# Firebase Documentation

Firebase integration setup, configuration, and implementation plans.

## 📋 Overview

Documentation for Firebase Authentication and other Firebase services integration with the Archery Apprentice app.

## 📚 Documents

### Setup & Configuration
- **[[Firebase-Setup]]** - Complete setup instructions for local development and CI/CD

### Implementation Planning
- **[[Firebase-Integration-Plan]]** - Strategic plan for Firebase integration

### Security
- **[[Firebase-Security-Rules]]** - Firestore security rules for tournament scoring

## 🔧 Quick Setup

### Local Development
1. Download `google-services.json` from Firebase Console
2. Place in `app/` directory
3. File is automatically ignored by `.gitignore`

### CI/CD Setup
Configure these GitHub Secrets:
- `FIREBASE_PROJECT_NUMBER`
- `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`
- `FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET`
- `FIREBASE_MOBILE_SDK_APP_ID`
- `FIREBASE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`
- `FIREBASE_API_KEY`

## 🛡️ Security

### ✅ Secure Practices
- Firebase credentials excluded from version control
- CI/CD uses encrypted GitHub Secrets
- Template file provided for reference
- Clear separation of dev/prod configurations

### ❌ Avoid
- Never commit `google-services.json`
- Don't hardcode API keys in source
- Don't share credentials in chat/email

## 🏗️ Firebase Services

### Currently Implemented
- **Authentication**: Google Sign-In integration
- **Project Structure**: Basic Firebase configuration

### Planned Features
- User management and profiles
- Tournament data synchronization
- Real-time scoring updates
- Cloud backup and restore
