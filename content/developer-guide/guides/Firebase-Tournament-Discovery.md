# Phase 2: Tournament Discovery & Creation - Implementation Plan

## Overview

Implement tournament discovery, creation, and basic management features using Firestore with offline-first architecture.

## Goals

- ✅ Users can discover public tournaments
- ✅ Users can create and configure tournaments
- ✅ Users can join/leave tournaments
- ✅ Preserve offline functionality for local tournaments
- ✅ Foundation for Phase 3 real-time features

## Week 1: Firestore Data Models & Repository Layer

### ✅ COMPLETED: Day 1-2: Tournament Data Models

**Status**: ✅ **ALL IMPLEMENTED**

```kotlin
// Primary models: ✅ ALL IMPLEMENTED
- Tournament.kt (main tournament document) ✅ With security & privacy features
- TournamentParticipant.kt (participant in tournament) ✅ With progress tracking
- TournamentSettings.kt (tournament configuration) ✅ Comprehensive configuration
- TournamentStatus enum (OPEN, IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETED, CANCELLED) ✅
- SecurityModels.kt ✅ GDPR compliance, anti-cheating, privacy controls
- Enhanced Round.kt ✅ Tournament integration fields added
```

### ✅ COMPLETED: Day 3-4: Firestore Repository Implementation

**Status**: ✅ **ALL IMPLEMENTED**

```kotlin
// Repository layer: ✅ ALL IMPLEMENTED
- TournamentRepository.kt (interface) ✅ 93 comprehensive methods
- FirebaseTournamentRepository.kt (Firestore implementation) ✅ With security validation
- OfflineTournamentRepository.kt (Room-based local tournaments) ✅ In-memory with sync
- HybridTournamentRepository.kt (combines both) ✅ Offline-first strategy
```

**Key Features Added:**
- Tournament lifecycle management (OPEN → IN_PROGRESS → COMPLETED)
- Join codes and capacity management
- Security settings and privacy controls
- GDPR compliance with user consent tracking
- Anti-cheating measures and suspicious activity detection
- Offline-first sync status tracking

### ✅ COMPLETED: Day 5: Integration Testing

**Completed Items:**
- ✅ Firestore security rules setup (comprehensive anti-cheating measures)
- ✅ Repository integration complete (offline-first with automatic sync)
- ✅ Integration with existing Round model (tournamentId, syncStatus fields added)

### Repository Capabilities

**Tournament Discovery & Management:**
```kotlin
fun getPublicTournaments(): Flow<List<Tournament>>
fun getMyTournaments(userId: String): Flow<List<Tournament>>
suspend fun createTournament(tournament: Tournament): Result<TournamentId>
suspend fun joinTournament(tournamentId: TournamentId, participant: TournamentParticipant): Result<Unit>
```

**Real-time Scoring & Leaderboards:**
```kotlin
suspend fun submitScore(tournamentId: TournamentId, participantId: String, roundNumber: Int, arrowScores: List<Int>): Result<Unit>
fun getTournamentLeaderboard(tournamentId: TournamentId): Flow<List<LeaderboardEntry>>
fun getTournamentStats(tournamentId: TournamentId): Flow<TournamentStats>
```

**Offline Support & Sync:**
```kotlin
suspend fun createLocalTournament(tournament: Tournament, participants: List<SessionParticipant>): Result<TournamentId>
suspend fun syncLocalTournament(localTournamentId: TournamentId): Result<Unit>
fun getTournamentsNeedingSync(): Flow<List<Tournament>>
```

**Security & Moderation:**
```kotlin
suspend fun flagSuspiciousActivity(tournamentId: TournamentId, participantId: String, activityType: String, details: String): Result<Unit>
fun getTournamentSecurityEvents(tournamentId: TournamentId): Flow<List<SecurityEvent>>
suspend fun banUser(tournamentId: TournamentId, userId: String, reason: String): Result<Unit>
```

## Week 2: Tournament Discovery & Management UI

### Day 1-2: Tournament Discovery Screen

**UI Components:**
```kotlin
- TournamentDiscoveryScreen.kt (main screen)
- TournamentCard.kt (individual tournament display)
- TournamentFilterSheet.kt (filter by status, type, etc.)
```

### Day 3-4: Tournament Creation Flow

**Creation workflow:**
```kotlin
- CreateTournamentScreen.kt (tournament setup)
- TournamentConfigScreen.kt (rules, participants, etc.)
- TournamentPreviewScreen.kt (review before creation)
```

### Day 5: Tournament Management

**Management features:**
```kotlin
- MyTournamentsScreen.kt (tournaments user created/joined)
- TournamentDetailsScreen.kt (view tournament info)
- JoinTournamentDialog.kt (join with code/invitation)
```

## Week 3: Integration & Polish

### Day 1-2: Navigation Integration

- Add tournament routes to MainActivity
- Update landing page with tournament discovery
- Connect with existing round scoring system

### Day 3-4: Offline Tournament Support

- Local tournament creation for offline use
- Sync pending changes when online
- Conflict resolution for tournaments

### Day 5: Testing & Documentation

- End-to-end testing
- Update feature flags for gradual rollout
- Documentation updates

## Technical Implementation Details

### Firestore Collection Structure

```
tournaments/{tournamentId}
├── Basic tournament info (name, description, creator, status)
├── participants/{participantId} → TournamentParticipant
├── rounds/{roundId} → Tournament-specific round data
└── settings → TournamentSettings (rules, format, etc.)
```

### Integration with Existing Round System

```kotlin
// Enhanced Round model:
data class Round(
    // ... existing fields
    val tournamentId: String? = null,  // Link to tournament
    val tournamentRoundNumber: Int? = null,  // Round number in tournament
    val isLocal: Boolean = true  // Local vs tournament round
)
```

### Offline-First Strategy

1. **Create local tournament** → works offline
2. **Sync to Firestore** → when online
3. **Hybrid repository** → seamless online/offline
4. **Conflict resolution** → last-write-wins with versioning

## Feature Flags for Gradual Rollout

### Phase 2A: Tournament Creation (Week 1)

```kotlin
const val ENABLE_TOURNAMENT_CREATION = false
const val ENABLE_TOURNAMENT_DISCOVERY = false
```

### Phase 2B: Discovery & Joining (Week 2)

```kotlin
const val ENABLE_TOURNAMENT_DISCOVERY = true
const val ENABLE_TOURNAMENT_JOINING = false
```

### Phase 2C: Full Tournament Management (Week 3)

```kotlin
const val ENABLE_TOURNAMENT_JOINING = true
const val ENABLE_TOURNAMENT_MANAGEMENT = true
```

## Success Criteria

### Week 1 Completion: ✅ **COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY**

- [x] Tournament data models defined and tested
- [x] Repository layer implemented with offline support
- [x] Basic Firestore operations working
- [x] Security rules configured

**What Was Accomplished:**
- **Tournament.kt**: Comprehensive tournament entity with security and privacy features
- **TournamentParticipant.kt**: Participant management with progress tracking
- **SecurityModels.kt**: GDPR compliance, anti-cheating, and privacy controls
- **TournamentRepository.kt**: Interface with 93 methods for complete tournament operations
- **FirebaseTournamentRepository.kt**: Full Firestore implementation with security validation
- **OfflineTournamentRepository.kt**: Local tournament support for offline functionality
- **HybridTournamentRepository.kt**: Offline-first strategy with automatic sync
- **Enhanced Round.kt**: Integration with tournament system via tournamentId and sync status

### Week 2 Completion

- [ ] Tournament discovery UI functional
- [ ] Tournament creation workflow complete
- [ ] Users can browse and join tournaments
- [ ] Feature flags controlling access

### Week 3 Completion

- [ ] Full tournament management available
- [ ] Offline tournament creation working
- [ ] Integration with existing round system
- [ ] Documentation and testing complete

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

- **Firestore quota limits** → Implement efficient queries and caching
- **Complex state management** → Use existing StateFlow patterns
- **Offline sync conflicts** → Simple last-write-wins initially

### UX Risks

- **Too many tournament options** → Start with basic tournament types
- **Complex creation flow** → Use existing round creation patterns
- **Confusing offline vs online** → Clear visual indicators

## Dependencies & Prerequisites

**Required Before Starting:**
- ✅ Phase 1 authentication working
- ✅ Real Firebase project with Firestore enabled
- ✅ Security rules configured
- ✅ Existing Round/SessionParticipant models understood

**External Setup Needed:**
1. **Firestore Database**: Enable in Firebase console
2. **Security Rules**: Configure for tournament access
3. **Indexes**: Create composite indexes for tournament queries
4. **Testing**: Set up Firestore emulator for development

## Next Phase Preview (Phase 3)

Phase 2 creates the foundation for Phase 3 real-time features:
- **Tournament lifecycle** → Live tournament progression
- **Participant management** → Real-time join/leave
- **Tournament settings** → Live configuration updates
- **Round integration** → Tournament-specific scoring

The offline-first architecture ensures Phase 3 real-time features enhance rather than replace offline functionality.
