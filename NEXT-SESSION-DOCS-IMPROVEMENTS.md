# Documentation Structure Improvements - Session 2 Prompt

**Date Created:** 2025-11-01
**Previous Session:** Quick Wins (PR #30) ✅ MERGED
**Current Phase:** Short-Term Improvements (Week 2-3 work)
**Estimated Effort:** 26 hours

---

## Context: What We've Accomplished

### Comprehensive Structure Analysis Completed ✅

We conducted a thorough exploration of the entire documentation structure (268 markdown files, 35 directories) and identified 23 prioritized improvements. Full analysis available in session context.

**Key Findings:**
- Three-tier structure (user/developer/internal) is sound
- Execution issues: duplication, naming chaos, empty stubs, structural sprawl
- 80% of subsections are empty stubs
- Significant duplication between root/ and content/
- Mixed naming conventions (kebab-case, PascalCase, lowercase)

### Quick Wins Implementation ✅ (PR #30 - MERGED)

**Completed in Session 1 (~2 hours):**

1. **Deleted 61 stub README.md files** - Using index.md only
2. **Flattened redundant nesting** - Fixed kmp-migration/kmp-migration/, Data-Models/Data-Models/, analysis/Analysis/
3. **Consolidated project tracking** - Renamed project-status/ → project-tracking/
4. **Organized user features** - Created equipment/, scoring/, sync/ subdirectories with kebab-case names
5. **Created kmp-migration/index.md** - Comprehensive 180-line navigation hub

**Impact:** 91 files changed, -531 lines of redundant content, much cleaner structure

---

## Your Mission: Short-Term Improvements (Week 2-3)

Continue the documentation transformation by implementing the next 4 high-priority fixes. These are more involved than Quick Wins but have massive impact.

### Priority 6: Bulk Rename to kebab-case (8 hours)

**Problem:** Inconsistent naming across ~100 directories
- Mix of kebab-case (`api-reference`), PascalCase (`Code-Examples`, `Data-Models`), lowercase (`architecture`)
- Creates unpredictable URLs, hard to navigate, Git case-sensitivity issues

**Task:** Standardize ALL directory and file names to kebab-case

**Approach:**
1. Create migration script: `scripts/migration/rename-to-kebab-case.py`
   - Scan all directories in content/
   - Detect non-kebab-case names
   - Generate rename commands (git mv)
   - Update all markdown links automatically
   - Dry-run mode for preview

2. Execute renames in batches:
   - Batch 1: developer-guide/ directories (~50 dirs)
   - Batch 2: internal/ directories (~30 dirs)
   - Batch 3: user-guide/ directories (~20 dirs)

3. Test after each batch:
   - Check Quartz build
   - Verify no broken links
   - Git commit

**Examples:**
- `Code-Examples` → `code-examples`
- `Data-Models` → `data-models`
- `Common-Patterns` → `common-patterns`
- `Project-Management` → `project-management` (already done!)
- `Testing-Examples` → `testing-examples`

**Important Notes:**
- Use `git mv` to preserve history
- Update ALL links in markdown files (grep + sed)
- Test Quartz build after changes
- Commit in batches (not all at once)

### Priority 7: Consolidate Duplicates (12 hours)

**Problem:** Content exists in both root/ and content/ directories
- Testing/ in root vs developer-guide/testing/
- Architecture/ in root vs developer-guide/architecture/
- Flows/ in root vs developer-guide/technical-reference/Flows/
- Firebase/ in root vs developer-guide/technical-reference/ (needs creation)

**Task:** Move ALL content to content/ only (single source of truth)

**Approach:**
1. **Testing/ consolidation:**
   ```bash
   # Move root Testing/ → content/developer-guide/testing/
   git mv Testing/*.md content/developer-guide/testing/
   # Update frontmatter if needed
   # Delete empty Testing/ in root
   ```

2. **Architecture/ consolidation:**
   ```bash
   # Move root Architecture/ → content/developer-guide/architecture/
   # Check for duplicates (some may already exist)
   # Merge or keep newer version
   ```

3. **Flows/ consolidation:**
   ```bash
   # Already in content/developer-guide/technical-reference/Flows/
   # Move root Flows/ content if any exists
   ```

4. **Firebase/ consolidation:**
   ```bash
   # Create developer-guide/technical-reference/firebase/
   # Move root Firebase/ content
   ```

**Important Notes:**
- Check for duplicates before moving (same filename in both locations)
- If duplicate exists, compare content and keep better version
- Update all cross-references
- Add frontmatter to migrated files if missing

### Priority 8: Flatten Technical Reference (6 hours)

**Problem:** Max depth is 4+ levels, violates 3-level rule
- `technical-reference/API/DAOs/` (4 levels)
- `technical-reference/Code-Examples/Common-Patterns/` (4 levels)

**Task:** Reduce max depth to 3 levels everywhere

**Approach:**
1. **Flatten API structure:**
   ```
   Before: technical-reference/API/DAOs/
   After:  technical-reference/api/daos/

   Before: technical-reference/API/Repositories/
   After:  technical-reference/api/repositories/
   ```

2. **Flatten Code-Examples:**
   ```
   Before: technical-reference/Code-Examples/Common-Patterns/
   After:  technical-reference/code-examples/
   (use tags or file naming for categorization)
   ```

3. **Update navigation:**
   - Update developer-guide/index.md with new structure
   - Create index.md files for flattened sections

**Important Notes:**
- This combines with kebab-case standardization (Priority 6)
- Do kebab-case FIRST, then flatten
- Use tags in frontmatter for categorization instead of deep nesting

### Priority 9: Consolidate Internal Sprawl (8 hours)

**Problem:** 16 top-level folders in internal/ with overlapping purposes

**Task:** Reduce to 6-8 categories

**Approach:**
1. **Create archive/ folder:**
   ```bash
   mkdir content/internal/archive
   # Move stale content:
   git mv content/internal/experiments/ content/internal/archive/
   git mv content/internal/sessions/ content/internal/archive/ (older than 3 months)
   git mv content/internal/tech-debt/ content/internal/archive/
   ```

2. **Consolidate similar folders:**
   ```bash
   # technical-notes/ + development-patterns/ → Should be in developer-guide/
   # Move to developer-guide/how-to/best-practices/

   # code-graph/ → archive/ (old analysis)
   ```

3. **Final internal/ structure:**
   ```
   internal/
   ├── kmp-migration/ (keep - well organized)
   ├── agents/ (keep)
   ├── project-tracking/ (keep - already consolidated)
   ├── retrospectives/ (keep)
   ├── meta/ (keep - add archive/ sessions here)
   └── archive/ (create - experiments, stale analysis, old sessions)
   ```

**Important Notes:**
- Create internal/archive/README.md explaining archive policy
- Move technical-notes/ and development-patterns/ to developer-guide/
- Keep only active, relevant content in internal/

---

## Execution Plan

### Step 1: Bulk Rename to kebab-case (Day 1-2)
1. Write rename script with dry-run mode
2. Test on developer-guide/ first
3. Execute in batches, test after each
4. Commit with detailed message

### Step 2: Consolidate Duplicates (Day 2-3)
1. Compare root/ vs content/ versions
2. Move content to content/
3. Update cross-references
4. Test Quartz build

### Step 3: Flatten Technical Reference (Day 3)
1. Reduce depth to max 3 levels
2. Update navigation
3. Create missing index.md files

### Step 4: Consolidate Internal Sprawl (Day 3-4)
1. Create archive/
2. Move stale content
3. Relocate technical-notes/ to developer-guide/
4. Update internal/index.md

## Questions to Ask User (If Needed)

1. **Kebab-case edge cases:**
   - Should acronyms be lowercase? (API → api or keep API?)
   - Component names in examples: ViewModel → view-model or ViewModel?

2. **Duplicate content resolution:**
   - If root/ and content/ have same file but different content, which to keep?
   - Merge both versions or choose newer?

3. **Archive policy:**
   - How old before archiving? (3 months? 6 months?)
   - Keep session docs or archive all?

4. **Technical notes migration:**
   - Move to developer-guide/how-to/ or developer-guide/technical-reference/?

"Agent D - Session 2: Short-Term Documentation Improvements

I'm continuing the documentation transformation project. Today's focus: kebab-case standardization, duplicate consolidation, flattening technical reference, and consolidating internal sprawl.

Starting with Priority 6: Bulk rename to kebab-case. I'll create the migration script first, run in dry-run mode for review, then execute in batches.
