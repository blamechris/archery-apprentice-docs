## 1. Structural Issues

### 1.1 Directory Organization

**Current Structure:**
```
content/
├── Agent-Work/          (2 files) ⚠️ Severely incomplete
├── Analysis/            (3 files)
├── bugs/                (1 file)
├── Code-Graph/          (4 files)
├── Data-Models/         (2 files)
├── Development-Journal/ (empty?)
├── experiments/         (1 file)
├── Firebase/            (6 files)
├── Flows/               (5 files)
├── journal/             (empty?)
├── Meta/                (NEW - for this audit)
├── Project-Overview/    (1 file)
├── projects/            (includes kmp-migration/)
│   └── kmp-migration/
│       ├── Architecture/        (3 files)
│       └── Project Management/  (1 file)
├── Tech-Debt/           (2 files)
├── Tournament/          (4 files)
└── [Symlinks to other locations]
```

**Issues:**
1. **Inconsistent naming**: Some directories use hyphens (Agent-Work), others use spaces (Daily Journal)
2. **Empty directories**: Development-Journal, journal appear empty
3. **Symlinks**: Multiple symlinks to external locations create confusion
4. **Flat root structure**: Several standalone files at content/ root level

**Recommendations:**
- ✅ Standardize directory naming (use hyphens consistently)
- ✅ Remove or document empty directories
- ✅ Consider consolidating symlinked content into vault proper
- ✅ Move root-level files into appropriate categories

---

### 1.2 Orphaned Files

**Files with unclear purpose or no links:**

1. `content/Performance-Optimization.md` - Empty file (0 bytes)
2. `content/WikiLinks.md` - Empty file (0 bytes)
3. `content/Next Session Focus.md` - Appears to be a working document, should be in journal/
4. `content/settings-architecture.md` - Old architecture doc, should be archived or moved

**Recommendation**: Archive empty files, move working docs to appropriate directories

---

### 1.3 Naming Inconsistencies

**Inconsistent patterns found:**

| Category | Examples | Issue |
|---|---|---|
| Agent summaries | `Agent-O-Week-10-Summary.md` vs `Agent-1-AAP-Week-11-Infrastructure.md` | Inconsistent naming pattern |
| Directories | `Agent-Work` vs `Daily Journal` vs `Development-Journal` | Hyphens vs spaces |
| KMP migration | Some use "Week-11" others use "Week 11" | Hyphenation inconsistent |

**Recommendation**:
- Use hyphens consistently in file names
- Use format: `Agent-[ID]-[Role]-Week-[N]-[Topic].md`
- Example: `Agent-1-AAP-Week-11-Infrastructure.md` ✅

---

## 2. Content Gaps

### 2.1 Missing Agent Work Summaries

**CRITICAL GAP**: Agent work is severely underdocumented in vault

**What exists:**
- ✅ Agent O Week 10 Summary
- ✅ Agent 1 (AAP) Week 11 Infrastructure

**What's missing:**
- ❌ **Week 5**: All agents (Agents 1, 2, 3, O)
- ❌ **Week 6**: All agents
- ❌ **Week 7**: All agents
- ❌ **Week 8**: All agents
- ❌ **Week 9**: All agents
- ❌ **Week 10**: Agents 1, 2, 3 (only Agent O exists)
- ❌ **Week 11**: Agents 2, 3, O (only Agent 1 exists, work in progress)

**Code repo has agent contexts but they're not vault entries:**
- `docs/AGENT_CONTEXTS/AGENT_1_AAP.md` - Context file, not a summary
- `docs/AGENT_CONTEXTS/AGENT_2_AAM.md` - Context file, not a summary
- `docs/AGENT_CONTEXTS/AGENT_3_AAA.md` - Context file, not a summary
- `docs/AGENT_CONTEXTS/AGENT_O_ORCHESTRATOR.md` - Context file, not a summary

**Impact**: Historical record of agent work is incomplete. Cannot trace Week 5-9 accomplishments.

**Recommendation**: HIGH PRIORITY - Create vault entries for missing weeks

---

## 9. Sync Strategy Recommendation

### 9.1 Manual vs Automated

**Current approach: Manual sync**
- Pros: Curated, vault is "published" subset
- Cons: Labor-intensive, creates gaps

**Alternative: Automated sync**
- Pros: Vault always up-to-date
- Cons: Vault becomes duplicate of code repo, no curation

**Recommendation: Hybrid approach**
1. **Auto-sync directories**: kmp-migration/, architecture/, testing/
2. **Manual curation**: Agent summaries, guides, meta docs
3. **Periodic review**: Monthly sync check

---

### 9.2 Priority Sync List

**High-priority directories to sync:**
1. `docs/kmp-migration/` → `content/projects/kmp-migration/`
2. `docs/retrospectives-kmp-migration/` → `content/projects/kmp-migration/Retrospectives/`
3. `docs/testing/` → `content/Testing/`
4. `docs/architecture/` → `content/Architecture/` (symlink?)

**Low-priority (skip for now):**
- `docs/COLD_STORAGE/` - Already archived
- `docs/multi-agent-setup/` - Experimental
- Historical implementation-status files

---

## 10. Conclusion

### 10.1 Key Takeaways
