# Tournament Multi-Device Testing Checklist

## Overview
Manual testing checklist for tournament features with real-time sync across multiple devices. Test all scenarios before merging tournament-related PRs.

**Requirements:**
- 2 Android devices/emulators running the app
- Firebase connection
- ~20-30 minutes for full test suite

---

## üéØ Test Setup

### Device Setup
- [ ] **Device A**: Emulator or physical device (will be tournament creator)
- [ ] **Device B**: Second emulator or physical device (will be participant)
- [ ] Both devices have app installed and can connect to Firebase
- [ ] Clear app data on both devices before testing: `adb shell pm clear com.archeryapprentice.debug`

---

## üìã Test Cases

### 1. Tournament Creation and Discovery
**Goal:** Verify tournament creation and cross-device discovery

#### Device A (Creator):
- [ ] Open app and navigate to Tournaments
- [ ] Create new tournament:
  - Name: "Multi-Device Test Tournament"
  - Public tournament (toggle ON)
  - Max participants: 10
  - Allow anonymous participants: YES
- [ ] Verify tournament appears in "My Tournaments"
- [ ] Note the tournament ID/name for Device B

#### Device B (Participant):
- [ ] Open app and navigate to Tournaments
- [ ] Browse "Public Tournaments"
- [ ] **VERIFY:** Find "Multi-Device Test Tournament" in the list
- [ ] **VERIFY:** Tournament shows correct status (OPEN)
- [ ] **VERIFY:** Shows available spots (0/8)

**Expected Result:** ‚úÖ Tournament created by Device A is discoverable by Device B

---

### 2. Multi-Participant Joining
**Goal:** Verify multiple participants can join the same tournament

#### Device A:
- [ ] Join your own tournament "Multi-Device Test Tournament"
- [ ] Add a guest participant:
  - Name: "Guest Player A"
- [ ] Verify you see 2 participants (yourself + guest)

#### Device B:
- [ ] Join "Multi-Device Test Tournament"
- [ ] **VERIFY:** See 3 total participants:
  - Device A user
  - Guest Player A (added by Device A)
  - Device B user

#### Device A (verification):
- [ ] **VERIFY:** See all 3 participants updated in real-time
- [ ] **VERIFY:** Participant indicators show:
  - ‚òÖ for your own participant
  - ‚òÖ for your guest
  - üëÅ for Device B user (view-only)

**Expected Result:** ‚úÖ All devices see all participants with correct controllability indicators

---

### 3. Concurrent Scoring Synchronization
**Goal:** Verify scores sync in real-time across devices

#### Device A:
- [ ] Start scoring for your participant
- [ ] Score End 1: 10, 9, 8 (Total: 27)
- [ ] Submit end

#### Device B (immediately after):
- [ ] Start scoring for your participant
- [ ] Score End 1: 9, 9, 9 (Total: 27)
- [ ] Submit end
- [ ] Wait 5 seconds for sync

#### Both Devices (verification):
- [ ] **VERIFY:** Leaderboard shows both participants with 27 points
- [ ] **VERIFY:** Both devices show the same leaderboard data
- [ ] **VERIFY:** Scores updated within 5 seconds

**Expected Result:** ‚úÖ Concurrent scoring synchronizes across all devices

---

### 4. Leaderboard Ranking with Ties
**Goal:** Verify standard competition ranking (tied participants share rank)

#### Using results from Test 3:
- [ ] **VERIFY Device A:** Both participants show Rank 1 (tied for first)
- [ ] **VERIFY Device B:** Both participants show Rank 1 (tied for first)

#### Add a third score:
- [ ] Device A scores End 2: 7, 7, 7 (Total: 21, Running Total: 48)
- [ ] Wait for sync

#### Both Devices:
- [ ] **VERIFY:** Leaderboard shows:
  - Rank 1: Device B (27 points)
  - Rank 2: Device A (48 points) ‚Üê Note: Lower rank because higher score
- [ ] **VERIFY:** Ranking updates on both devices

**Expected Result:** ‚úÖ Tie handling works correctly with standard competition ranking

---

### 5. Average Score Calculation
**Goal:** Verify average is calculated per-end (not per-arrow)

#### Device A:
- [ ] Check your participant's stats:
  - Total Score: 48 (from 27 + 21)
  - Ends Completed: 2
  - **VERIFY:** Average Score: 24.0 (48 √∑ 2 ends)

#### Device B:
- [ ] Check Device A's participant stats from your device
- [ ] **VERIFY:** Shows same average score: 24.0

**Expected Result:** ‚úÖ Average score = Total √∑ Ends (not Total √∑ Arrows)

---

### 6. Sync Status Indicators
**Goal:** Verify sync status badges appear correctly

#### Device A:
- [ ] View participant roster
- [ ] **VERIFY:** Your participant shows ‚òÖ (controllable)
- [ ] **VERIFY:** Your guest shows ‚òÖ Guest (Yours)
- [ ] **VERIFY:** Device B user shows üëÅ Network Player (view-only)

#### Device B:
- [ ] View participant roster
- [ ] **VERIFY:** Your participant shows ‚òÖ (controllable)
- [ ] **VERIFY:** Device A user shows üëÅ Network Player (view-only)
- [ ] **VERIFY:** Guest Player A shows üëÅ Guest (Other's) (view-only)

**Expected Result:** ‚úÖ Controllability indicators correctly show who can modify which participants

---

### 7. Name Truncation and Chip Display
**Goal:** Verify participant names display correctly in chips and full views

#### Device A:
- [ ] Add another guest with long name: "Christopher Alexander"
- [ ] **VERIFY:** Chip shows "CHR" (3 letters)
- [ ] **VERIFY:** Full name visible in participant roster
- [ ] **VERIFY:** Name truncates with ellipsis if too long in tabs

#### Add collision scenario:
- [ ] Add two more guests:
  - "Guest 1"
  - "Guest 2"
- [ ] **VERIFY:** Chips show "GU1", "GU2" (collision detection working)

**Expected Result:** ‚úÖ Names truncate correctly, collision detection works

---

### 8. Tournament Round Progress Header
**Goal:** Verify progress header shows correct information

#### Device A:
- [ ] Open scoring screen
- [ ] **VERIFY:** Header shows:
  - Tournament name
  - Current end (e.g., "End 2 of 10")
  - Participant count
  - Online tournament indicator (cloud icon)

#### Device B:
- [ ] Open scoring screen
- [ ] **VERIFY:** Same header information
- [ ] **VERIFY:** Real-time sync indicator shows "Connected"

**Expected Result:** ‚úÖ Progress header displays accurate real-time tournament info

### 9. Tournament Deletion and Cleanup
**Goal:** Verify tournament deletion removes data for all participants

#### Device A (Creator only):
- [ ] Navigate to tournament details
- [ ] Delete tournament
- [ ] Confirm deletion

#### Device B (within 10 seconds):
- [ ] **VERIFY:** Tournament disappears from "My Tournaments"
- [ ] **VERIFY:** Tournament no longer appears in "Public Tournaments"
- [ ] **VERIFY:** Attempting to view tournament shows "Tournament not found"

**Expected Result:** ‚úÖ Deletion propagates to all devices, tournament completely removed

### 10. Orphaned Tournament Filtering
**Goal:** Verify tournaments deleted remotely don't appear in local lists

#### Setup:
- [ ] Device A creates "Test Orphan Tournament"
- [ ] Device B joins the tournament
- [ ] Device A deletes tournament from Firebase Console (or via Device A app)

#### Device B:
- [ ] Pull to refresh tournament list
- [ ] **VERIFY:** "Test Orphan Tournament" removed from "My Tournaments"
