# Agent D - Session Status Update for Agent O

**Date:** 2025-11-01
**Session:** Week 12 Documentation Continuation → Week 13-14 Migration Break
**Agent:** Agent D (Documentation)
**Orchestrator:** Agent O
**Purpose:** Status handoff before next session

---

## Mission Overview

You were paused during Week 13-14 for the KMP database migration (Agents 1, 2, 3 priority work). Now that Phase 1c is wrapping up, Agent O needs a brief status update on your documentation work before planning the next session.

**This is NOT a work session** - just a status report.

---

## What Agent O Needs

### 1. Current Work Status

**Question:** Where did you leave off before the migration pause?

**Please provide:**
- Last task completed
- Current task (if mid-work)
- PR status (PR #35 - is it ready for review? merged? waiting on something?)

### 2. Pending Work Summary

**Question:** What documentation tasks are still pending from your original plan?

**Context:** From earlier sessions, you were working on:
- Priority 0: Live site critical fixes (capitalization, orphaned links, category confusion)
- Priority 1: Bulk rename to kebab-case
- Priority 2: Consolidate duplicates
- Priority 3: Flatten technical reference
- Priority 4: Consolidate internal sprawl

**Please clarify:**
- Which priorities completed?
- Which priorities in progress or pending?
- Estimated time remaining on current plan

### 3. Branch & PR Status

**Questions:**
- What branch are you currently on?
- Is PR #35 created and ready for user review?
- Are there uncommitted changes?
- Any blockers preventing completion?

### 4. Next Session Readiness

**Question:** Are you ready to resume documentation work in the next session, or do you need any context/handoff from the KMP migration work?

**Considerations:**
- Do you need to document the Week 13-14 database migration?
- Do you need updated context from Agents 1, 2, 3 about the KMP work?
- Can you resume your original plan immediately, or do priorities need adjustment?
