## ✅ Week 1 COMPLETE - All 3 Agents Delivered

### Summary
Week 1 of the Kotlin Multiplatform migration is complete! All 4 PRs merged to main:
- **PR #127** - Agent 3 (AAA): God class analysis & migration roadmap
- **PR #130** - Agent 2 (AAM): 6 KMP shared modules created
- **PR #131** - Agent O: Orchestrator documentation & coordination protocol
- **PR #128** - Agent 1 (AAP): Platform abstractions & Context removal

**Timeline:** 7 days (Oct 18-20) - 2.3x faster than sequential development

**Foundation Complete:**
- ✅ Platform abstractions: Domain layer is platform-agnostic
- ✅ Module structure: 6 KMP shared modules ready for migration  
- ✅ Strategic roadmap: God class extraction plans documented
- ✅ Coordination protocol: Agent context handoff established

---

## 📊 Week 1 Key Metrics

**Code Changes:**
- 76 files changed
- 6,977 lines added
- 420 lines removed
- Net: +6,557 lines

**Test Infrastructure:**
- 4 new platform abstraction test files
- 96 test occurrences updated across 15 files
- Coverage enforcement enabled (60% patch / 80% project)

**Documentation:**
- 11 new/updated documentation files
- 9 critical issues documented and resolved
- Comprehensive Week 1 retrospective created

---

## 🔍 Critical Discoveries from Week 1

### Issue 7: Coverage NOT Actually Enforced
**Discovery:** CI/CD was passing despite <80% coverage - enforcement was disabled
**Resolution:** Enabled strict enforcement with hybrid approach (60% patch / 80% project)
**Lesson:** Verify tooling claims before trusting them

### Issue 9: JaCoCo Coverage Tool Limitations  
**Discovery:** JaCoCo+Robolectric cannot measure:
- Reflection-invoked methods (ViewModel.onCleared)
- Empty method bodies (Repository.cleanup)
- Field initializers with Robolectric
- Async Flow operators in coroutines

**Resolution:** Documented limitations, adjusted expectations
**Alternative:** Investigate Kover (JetBrains tool) in Week 2+

### Parallel Agent Workflow Reality Check
**Expected:** 7x speedup with 3 parallel agents
**Actual:** 2-3x faster than sequential (still significant!)
**Why:** Discovery work, coverage validation, tooling configuration gaps
**Recommendation:** Use conservative 2-3x multiplier for future estimates

---

## 🚀 Immediate Next Steps (Week 2 Kickoff)

### 1. Resume All 3 Agents
**All agents must:**
- Pull latest main (includes all Week 1 changes)
- Review Week 1 retrospective: `docs/retrospectives-kmp-migration/week-1-retrospective.md`
- Update their context files with Week 1 completion status

### 2. Create Week 2 Branches
**Agent 1 (AAP):** Can reuse `archery-agent-platform` worktree
- Create new branch: `kmp-migration/week-2-code-migration`

**Agent 2 (AAM):** Must create new branch from main
- Location: `archery-agent-modules` worktree
- Command: `git checkout -b kmp-migration/week-2-repository-migration origin/main`

**Agent 3 (AAA):** Must create new branch from main
- Location: `archery-agent-analysis` worktree  
- Command: `git checkout -b kmp-migration/week-2-service-extraction origin/main`

### 3. Define Week 2 Missions (See Below)

---

## 📋 Week 2 Mission Planning

### Agent 1 (AAP) - Domain Code Migration
**Goal:** Migrate domain models and use cases to shared/domain

**Tasks:**
1. Migrate core domain models (Round, End, Arrow, etc.) to shared/domain
2. Migrate use cases to shared/domain
3. Ensure platform abstractions are used correctly
4. Update Android app to reference shared domain code
5. Maintain test coverage throughout migration

**Estimate:** 5-7 days (with coverage validation factored in)

**Dependencies:** Agent 2's shared modules (already complete)

---

### Agent 2 (AAM) - Repository Migration  
**Goal:** Migrate repository layer to shared code

**Tasks:**
1. Migrate repository interfaces to shared/domain
2. Migrate repository implementations to shared/data
3. Configure Room database in shared/database
4. Set up dependency injection for shared repositories
5. Update Android app to use shared repositories

**Estimate:** 5-7 days (with Room KMP configuration time)

**Dependencies:** Agent 1's domain models migration

**Coordination:** May need to sync with Agent 1 on domain model availability

---

### Agent 3 (AAA) - God Class Service Extraction
**Goal:** Continue reducing god classes via service extraction

**Tasks:**
1. Extract remaining services from LiveScoringViewModel:
   - ArrowScoringDomainService
   - ParticipantStateService
2. Begin HybridTournamentRepository split:
   - TournamentManagementRepository
   - ParticipantRepository
   - ScoringRepository
   - AnalyticsRepository
3. Extract statistics service from RoundViewModel

**Estimate:** 6-8 days (god class work is complex)

**Dependencies:** None (independent refactoring work)

**Coordination:** Service extraction may create new files that Agents 1 & 2 need to migrate

---

## ⚠️ Week 2 Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Agent Dependencies
**Problem:** Agent 2 needs Agent 1's domain models before migrating repositories
**Mitigation:** 
- Agent 1 goes first (start Week 2 Day 1)
- Agent 2 starts when domain models are available (Week 2 Day 3-4)
- Agent 3 works independently throughout

### Risk 2: Merge Conflicts from Service Extraction
**Problem:** Agent 3's service extraction may conflict with Agent 1's code migration
**Mitigation:**
- Strategic merge order: Agent 3 → Agent 1 → Agent 2
- Agent 3 extracts services early in Week 2
- Agents 1 & 2 pull main after Agent 3 merges

### Risk 3: Coverage Work Delays
**Problem:** Coverage gaps discovered at PR time extend timelines  
**Mitigation:**
- Plan coverage validation upfront, not at PR time
- Run coverage reports early and often (not just at PR)
- Use realistic targets (60% patch / 80% project)

### Risk 4: Tooling Surprises
**Problem:** More undocumented tooling issues like JaCoCo, detekt
**Mitigation:**
- Verify all tooling claims before trusting
- Run full CI/CD pipeline locally before pushing
- Document any new discoveries in agent context files

---

## 🔄 Agent Coordination Protocol (Week 2)

### Daily Sync (Via Context Files)
Each agent should:
1. Update their context file at end of day
2. Check other agents' context files at start of day
3. Flag any blockers or dependencies in context updates

### Merge Order Strategy
**Week 2 Merge Order:** Agent 3 → Agent 1 → Agent 2
- Agent 3: Service extraction (independent, safe to merge first)
- Agent 1: Domain migration (needs Agent 3's services)
- Agent 2: Repository migration (needs Agent 1's domain models)

### Cross-Agent Communication
Use the agent-context-sync skill:
1. Create update files when critical decisions are made
2. Commit to main or copy to agent worktrees
3. Reference in agent context files

---
