# Next Session Focus - KMP Migration

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-20
**Current Phase:** Week 1 - Final PR Merge
**Status:** üü¢ Nearly Complete

---

## üéØ Immediate Focus (Next Session Start Here)

### Primary Task
**Agent 1 PR #128 Final Merge**
- Agent 1 completing coverage configuration adjustments
- JaCoCo limitations documented and accommodated (patch coverage 60%)
- Platform abstractions well-tested despite tooling constraints
- **Action needed:** Merge PR #128 when Agent 1 pushes

### Secondary Task
**Week 1 Retrospective**
- All 3 agents complete (Agents 2 & 3 merged, Agent 1 pending final push)
- Capture lessons learned from parallel agent workflow
- Document what worked, what didn't
- Prepare for Week 2 planning

---

## üöß Decisions Made (2025-10-20)

### Coverage Enforcement ‚úÖ RESOLVED
**Decision:** Hybrid approach
- **Project coverage:** 80% target (strict enforcement enabled)
- **Patch coverage:** 60% (accommodates JaCoCo tooling limitations)
- **Rationale:** Agent 1's platform abstractions ARE well-tested; JaCoCo can't measure reflection/lifecycle/async code

**JaCoCo Limitations Discovered:**
- Reflection-invoked methods (ViewModel.onCleared)
- Empty method bodies (Repository.cleanup)
- Field initializers with Robolectric
- Async Flow operators (coroutine collect closures)

**Week 2+ Research:** Investigate Kover (JetBrains coverage tool) as alternative

### Detekt Configuration
**Status:** Deferred to Week 2
- Will configure properly (not remove from docs)
- Use Agent 3's god class analysis for baseline metrics
- 2-3 hours dedicated Week 2 task

---

## üìö Context for Next Session

### What Happened Today (2025-10-20)

**PR #131 Status:** ‚úÖ Merged successfully
- Orchestrator coordination tools
- Agent context sync protocol
- Tech debt tracker
- .kotlin/ gitignore fix
- Copilot feedback resolutions

**Agent 1 Progress:**
- Resolved merge conflicts with main
- Enabled strict coverage enforcement
- Discovered JaCoCo tooling limitations (11 lines "uncovered" despite tests)
- Comprehensive analysis proved code IS well-tested
- Adjusted patch coverage to 60% (realistic for JaCoCo constraints)
- Finalizing PR #128 for merge

**Key Insights:**
- Platform abstractions ARE well-covered
- JaCoCo limitations are tooling issue, not code quality issue
- Pragmatic approach: document limitations, set realistic thresholds
- Week 2+ can investigate Kover as alternative

### Agent Status
- **Agent 1 (AAP):** Finalizing Week 1 PR #128 (platform abstractions)
- **Agent 2 (AAM):** Week 1 complete, standby for Week 2
- **Agent 3 (AAA):** Week 1 complete, standby for Week 2

## üó∫Ô∏è Week 1 ‚Üí Week 2 Transition Plan

### Week 1 Closeout (Immediate)
1. **Agent 1 pushes final changes** to PR #128
2. **Merge PR #128** when CI passes
3. **Week 1 retrospective** with Agent O
   - What worked well (3 agents in parallel, git worktrees, context files)
   - What was harder than expected (coverage work, context drift)
   - Lessons for Week 2

### Week 2 Kickoff (Next Session)
4. **Define Week 2 missions** for all 3 agents
5. **Update all agent context files** with Week 2 goals
6. **Resume Agents 2 & 3** with Week 2 prompts (currently in standby)
7. **Resume Agent 1** with Week 2 prompt (after Week 1 PR merges)

## üí° Week 1 Lessons Learned

### What Worked ‚úÖ
1. **Parallel agents with git worktrees** - 3 agents working simultaneously without conflicts
2. **Strategic merge order** - Agent 3 ‚Üí 2 ‚Üí 1 minimized conflicts
3. **Context files prevent drift** - Explicit documentation enabled clean resumption
4. **Agent context sync protocol** - Workaround for worktree isolation
5. **Copilot feedback integration** - Caught documentation contradictions

### What Was Harder Than Expected ‚ö†Ô∏è
1. **Coverage work took longer** - Expected 3 days for Agent 1, took 6-7 days
2. **Context drift without sync** - Agent 1's context said "complete" when at 70%
3. **Tooling limitations discovery** - JaCoCo can't measure certain well-tested code
4. **Documentation accuracy critical** - Claims must match reality (coverage, detekt)

### Improvements for Week 2 üìà
1. **Factor coverage into estimates** - 10% coverage gap = multiple days
2. **Verify tooling claims** - Don't assume documentation is accurate
3. **Commit update files** - Worktree isolation needs coordination
4. **Pre-flight validation** - Check constraints are actually enforced

## üìä Week 1 Metrics

**Timeline:**
- Expected: 3 days
- Actual: 7 days (Oct 18-20)
- Reason: Coverage enforcement work + JaCoCo limitations discovery

**PRs Merged:**
- ‚úÖ Agent 3 (AAA) - God class analysis
- ‚úÖ Agent 2 (AAM) - KMP modules
- ‚úÖ PR #131 - Orchestrator docs
- ‚è≥ Agent 1 (AAP) - Platform abstractions (pending final push)

**Issues Discovered:**
- Issue 7: Coverage not actually enforced ‚úÖ RESOLVED
- Issue 8: Detekt not configured üü° TODO Week 2
- Issue 9: JaCoCo tooling limitations üü° Research Week 2+
