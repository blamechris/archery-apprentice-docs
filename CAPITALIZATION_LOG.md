## Capitalization Standard

**File Naming Convention:** Title-Case-With-Hyphens.md

**Rules:**
1. Each word starts with a capital letter
2. Words are separated by hyphens (-)
3. No spaces in file names
4. Exceptions: README.md, index.md

**Examples:**
- âœ… Firebase-Auth-State-Loss.md
- âœ… KMP-Migration-Project.md
- âœ… Multi-Participant-Ranking.md
- âŒ Firebase Auth State Loss.md (spaces)
- âŒ kmp-migration-project.md (lowercase start)
- âŒ multiParticipantRanking.md (camelCase)
